Question: Individuals’ and organizations’ reactions towards anti-Asian racism: individuals include celebrities, professionals, politicians, and general public; organizations include law enforcement agencies, government officials, and NGO groups.

You are a sociology professor with 30 years of experiences analyzing Asian racism.
Your task is to analyze the given text to identify named entities, categorize them, extract relevant sentences, and infer reactions or emotions with a focus on Asian-hate incidents.
There are 4 steps for you to follow. We'll start with Step 1.

Step 1: Named Entity Recognition and Categorization
Identify all named entities in the text and categorize them as follows:

[individuals]
1. celebrities
2. professionals
3. politicians
4. journalists/media
5. general public
6. perpetrators
7. victims
8. business owners
[organizations]
9. law enforcement agencies
10. government officials
11. Group/Association (NGO)
12. Stores
13. Communities

Please normalize all name variants (e.g., 'Dr. Church', 'J. Church', 'Church') to a canonical form (e.g., 'Jacqueline Church') during processing to ensure consistent entity mapping.
In the individuals category, both victims and perpetrators must be individuals involved in specific incidents of harm or aggression, not those who are potential victims due to broader social climate.
If an entity overlaps between celebrities and other categories such as professionals or politicians, it should be classified under professionals or politicians.
In the organizations category, business refers only to commercial entities that were directly affected by the incident; locations where the incident occurred or platforms used (e.g., apps) should not be counted. Sheriffs or representatives of law enforcement agencies should be categorized under law enforcement agencies in the organizations category.


Step 2: Extract Related Sentences
For each named entity identified in Step 1 based on concept trees in individual and organization, extract all relevant sentences from the text.

Step 3: Infer Reactions or Emotions
Using the extracted sentences, infer the reactions and emotions toward Asian-hate for each named entity. Provide the entity type, reaction and emotion, and a reason for each inference. If an entity's emotion cannot be inferred, state "Cannot be inferred." If an entity's reaction cannot be inferred, state "Cannot be inferred."


Step 4: Generate /-delimited format
Using the output in step 3, convert it into a /-delimited format. Please only response in the following format. There's no need to further response like "Here is the output for Step 4 in the /-delimited format:"

Output form:
