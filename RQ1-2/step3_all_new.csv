The requests all looked the same, and they would be familiar to any minority community dealing with tragedy. Tao was being asked these questions because eight people had been killed in a series of shootings in and around Atlanta on Tuesday night. Six of the victims were women of Asian descent. But even with eight people dead, there was debate about whether the attack was a hate crime. About whether racism was the primary motive. About whether America was finally ready to stop Asian hate. The truth is Tao was in San Francisco for her 20th wedding anniversary a few years ago when a woman kicked her luggage and told her to go back to her country. She hasn't experienced overt racism like that in Cincinnati. But the truth is she often feels invisible here, which takes its own heavy toll. Because there is no Chinatown here, and stories of prejudice against Asian people often go untold. Tao is a communications director for the Greater Cincinnati Chinese School in Butler County, and she founded the Greater Cincinnati Chinese Cultural Exchange Association. She is an advocate who knows Asian people are underrepresented in Cincinnati media, including The Enquirer. She knows this because she is the one sending press releases that often go unanswered. We don't exist, Tao said. Tao hasn't been directly confronted with a racist phrase describing the virus, but she's heard of others who have – including kids at school. She does fear one question, though: Where are you from? Because when the answer is Cincinnati, it's usually followed by another question: Where are you really from? Tao doesn't talk to them about the violent attacks against Asian Americans that seem to be happening more frequently across the country than ever before. Tao doesn't talk about how the number of hate crimes reported in America's biggest cities went down last year, according to a study at California State University, but the number of hate crimes reported against Asians rose 149%. Tao knows this comes from her own insecurity, because she wants her children to believe they can do anything. She doesn't want them to feel like victims. Even if, sometimes, they are. These days, Tao's own parents worry about her safety. And friends across the world ask why her family moved to America. Tao tries to brush off those fears, especially to her parents. She doesn't want to scare them. But the fear is there, inside her head. And it comes out in tears when she talks about her sons. Because she worries about their safety, too. When Tao thinks about the future of our country, this can-do person who prides herself on positivity finds herself wondering something she has never wondered before. 'I have doubt,' she said.",2021-03-21

Asian Americans are frequently humiliated and even attacked in public, and suffering continuous discrimination on social media platforms. The racial group faced a double whammy of unemployment and discrimination amid the outbreak, according to many reports recently released by American research institutions and civil society organizations. 31 percent of Asian Americans said they have been subject to racist slurs or jokes since the pandemic began, while 26 percent said they’ve feared someone might physically attack them, the survey found. Across the country, Asian American health-care workers have reported a rise in bigoted incidents, according to an article published on The Washington Post. The racial hostility has left Asian Americans, who represent 6 percent of the U.S. population but 18 percent of the country’s physicians and 10 percent of its nurse practitioners, in a painful position on the front lines of the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the article said. Some COVID-19 patients refuse to be treated by them. And when doctors and nurses leave the hospital, they face increasing harassment in their daily lives, too. Asian Americans now still suffer continuous harassment, exclusion and structural discrimination in the U.S., arousing great concern among the international community and American people with breadth of vision.",2020-09-16
