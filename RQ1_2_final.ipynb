    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Focus only on emotions — do NOT infer actions or behaviors.\n",
    "2. Always match each sentence’s emotional meaning with the deepest word in the tree first.\n",
    "   - You must select the **deepest matching term** in the concept tree — e.g., use `\"rage\"`, not just `\"Anger\"`.\n",
    "   - If no match exists at the deepest level, move up one level **only if truly no leaf-level word fits**.\n",
    "   - Do not invent new emotion terms.\n",
    "   - If no emotion is expressed at all, label `\"emotion\"` as `\"Cannot be inferred\"` and `\"emotion_path\"` as `null`.\n",
    "   - NEVER describe levels as \"primary\", \"secondary\", or \"tertiary\".\n",
    "3. Always output the `emotion_path` field:\n",
    "   - For tree matches: show the full path like `\"Anger → Rage → fury\"`.\n",
    "   - Incorrect example: `\"emotion\": \"disgust\", \"emotion_path\": \"Anger → Disgust → contempt\"`\n",
    "   - For `\"Cannot be inferred\"`: output `Cannot be inferred`.\n",
    "4. If multiple distinct emotions appear in the same sentence, list each as a separate object.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For each emotion, label its intensity as one of the following:\n",
    "    - **Neutral**: No clear emotion is expressed. The sentence is objective or emotionally flat.  \n",
    "      - _Example_: “The event happened on March 16.”  \n",
    "      - _Example_: “She gave a speech at the rally.”\n",
    "      - _Example_: “This situation needs attention.”\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Low**: Emotion is subtle, mild, or implied with a soft tone.  \n",
    "      - _Example_: “I feel a bit uneasy about this.”  \n",
    "      - _Example_: “It bothers me slightly, but I’m not surprised.”\n",
    "      - _Example_: “The situation is concerning.”\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Moderate**: Emotion is clearly present, but not intense or overwhelming.  \n",
    "      - _Example_: “I’m disappointed by how they handled the situation.”  \n",
    "      - _Example_: “This is frustrating and shouldn’t have happened.”\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **High**: Emotion is strong, intense, or expressed with urgency or emphasis.  \n",
    "      - _Example_: “I’m outraged! This is unacceptable!”  \n",
    "      - _Example_: “I cried when I saw what happened. I’m heartbroken.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use the examples above to guide your decisions. If no emotion is present, label it as **Neutral**.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use the exact sentence(s) from Step 2 as your `\"emotion_reason\"` — do NOT paraphrase.\n",
    "7. If no emotion is expressed at all, return:\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   \"emotions\": [\n",
    "     {\n",
    "       \"emotion\": \"Cannot be inferred\",\n",

    "       \"emotion_reason\": \"Exact sentence(s) from Step 2\"\n",
    "     }\n",
