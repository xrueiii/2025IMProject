Tan's family is from China, and she sometimes hosted Lunar New Year and Fourth of July parties with food and fireworks at her spa. “She was a very good friend, a kind, sweet person,” Greg Hynson told the paper. Tan's 29-year-old daughter, Jami Webb, told USA Today Tan worked “every day, 12 hours a day, so that me and our family would have a better life.” “She did everything for me and for the family,” Webb said. “She provided everything.” Michael Webb met Tan while traveling for work in China in the early 2000s, according to USA Today, and they got married in 2004. He legally adopted Jami in 2006 before the family moved from Florida to Georgia, where Tan opened her first business, a nail salon. She and Michael remained friends after they split up in 2012. Michael, a contractor, helped Tan remodel Young's Asian Massage, her second business, last year while it was closed due to COVID-19. “She'd always say, 'we family,'” Michael told USA Today. “Even when we got divorced, she'd say that: 'We family.'

Park spoke about the need to take care of his little brother in the wake of his mom's death. “You see this stuff in TV shows and movies,” Park said. “It's surreal. But I have a younger brother that I have to take care of now, so as much as I want to be sad and grieve — and I am super sad — I have no choice but to move on. To figure out the whole living situation for probably the next year with my brother.” Park said Grant wasn't just his mother but also his friend who he could tell anything to. Grant loved to go “dancing and partying,” Park said. They would go out for sushi every night before she left for work. In a GoFundMe page started by Park, he said he and his brother don't have other family members in the country. “The rest of my family is in South Korea and are unable to come,” he wrote. “She was one of my best friends and the strongest influence on who we are today. Losing her has put a new lens on my eyes on the amount of hate that exists in our world.” “My biggest priority right now is to put my mother to rest and plan out the funeral but due to some legal complications, I am unable to obtain my mother's body,” he wrote. “I don't think I'll be able to figure out this whole situation along with legal matters if given 2 weeks to move out.”",2021-03-19,49,mainstream,1
