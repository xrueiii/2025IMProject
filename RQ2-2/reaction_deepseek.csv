'One slur many people are probably familiar with is 'Wuhan Flu' which did not exist in the lexicon until COVID-19' he said. 'But we also found not only dozens of new slurs but more importantly that previously benign words like 'pangolin' were increasingly used as slurs.' Blackburn points out how difficult it is to measure the scope of the problem given how much the language has changed – even in the time since the pandemic started. 'One of the major challenges in measuring Sinophobic content is that it has rapidly evolved' he said. 'Although it is quite easy to look for occurrences of well known slurs we've seen all sorts of new Sinophobic terms arise.'"

Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative formed in March aimed at tracking and responding to incidents of violence and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, received more than 2,800 reports of racism and discrimination targeting Asian Americans from March 19 to Dec. 31. And even with new recognition from President Joe Biden — who last month signed a memorandum directing federal agencies to explore ways of combating racism and xenophobia against Asian American and Pacific Islanders in the United States — there is more work to be done. San Francisco is not the only area of the country seeing a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans. New York City saw a large surge in hate crimes directed at Asians in 2020 and most of the increase was directly related to the pandemic, police said. There were at least 28 hate crimes against Asians reported to the New York police, and all but four involved an assumption that the victim had the coronavirus, police said. But in 2021, some community organizers and advocacy groups, including Stop AAPI Hate, have said Asian Americans must look beyond calling for increased police presence in neighborhoods to achieve that justice. While she's troubled by the apparent rise in crimes against Asian Americans, she said her family saw the burglary as an extension of wider suffering in the pandemic."

reaction_7121,Article_284,Chinese Immigrants,victims,Asian,Cannot be inferred,"But the stigmatization of Chinese immigrants as a threat to public health and safety has a long history in the United States. Answering that requires returning to the epidemic of violence that swept the West after Chinese immigrants began settling in the U.S. in the 19th century. White Americans refused to live in proximity with Chinese settlements — literally, they refused to breathe the same air. As urban travelers in the West rode railroads built by Chinese migrants to take in the pure air of nature resorts, more than 100 violent purges forced Chinese immigrants out of rural settlements and into overcrowded, poorly ventilated accommodations in urban Chinatowns. Even after germ theory gained acceptance in the 1880s, they stigmatized Chinese air and smells, associating overcrowded spaces, laboring bodies, opium smoke, culinary odors, and incense in several urban Chinatowns with disease. This law was enforced exclusively against Chinese people, and critics noted that the city detained Chinese immigrants in jails that were much more overcrowded than their homes. Attributing Chinatown's poor air quality to cultural and biological differences, so-called experts like Bancroft drew attention away from the forces of mob violence, poverty, social marginalization, and housing inequity that had pushed Chinese immigrants into substandard living conditions. Stories about Chinese stench date back to the first decades of Chinese immigration. When they could afford to, Eaton suggested, Chinese immigrants preferred a cool and fragrant atmosphere: 'After the heat and dust and unsavoriness of the highways and byways of Chinatown, the young reporter who had been sent to find a story, had stepped across the threshold of a cool, deep room, fragrant with the odor of dried lilies and sandalwood, and found Pan.'"

Hong described the supplies as a lifeline for the seniors. ""The problem they are facing is twofold. On the one hand, the seniors, who mostly have various ailments, are afraid to go out in case they become infected. On the other, they are frightened by all the racism that has bubbled to the surface since the pandemic hit this country,"" Hong said. Hong said: ""Think about 50 crates of bananas and 340 crates of eggs. We seemed to be the only pantry in Lower Manhattan dealing with fresh, perishable food, as we wanted to give people a familiar taste."" Hong, citing examples of Asian Americans being physically and verbally attacked on the New York Subway, said: ""Before COVID-19, 40 percent of the people we served at our Midtown pantry on 26th Street were Asian Americans. That proportion has dropped to below 10 percent, although we now have a line that stretches for three blocks. Members of our community are not coming.""
