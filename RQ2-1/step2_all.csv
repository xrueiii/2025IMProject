They lived through the horrors of 9/11 and witnessed the discrimination against Muslims in the wake of those attacks.
Although they remained stoic and largely reserved in the decades that followed internment, their quiet resilience changed dramatically after 9/11.
They would begin to speak out against the injustices of that time, becoming activists in their own right.
But my parents were spurred to action after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
As fear, discrimination and violence toward Muslims increased, they spoke out against these injustices.
In recent years, they raised their voices again as federal policies became more punitive and restrictive for immigrants and refugees.
Normally soft-spoken and unassuming, my parents shared their experiences in panel discussions, newsletters and as featured guests of a multimedia exhibit depicting the internment of Japanese Americans, 'Then They Came for Me.'"

entity_15,Article_2,Donald Trump,politician,Non-Asian,"Nguyen worries that East Asians in the United States will face even more harassment and attacks as coronavirus cases continue to rise.
He said he believes President Donald Trump stoked such hate-filled reaction during a news briefing last week when he defended his use of 'Chinese virus.'
'It's not racist at all,' Trump said.
'I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China.'
He also said he was using the expression to fight back against Beijing officials who were blaming the U.S. military for the introduction of the disease.
On Monday, Trump appeared to walk back his earlier position, using the word 'coronavirus' and stressing it was important to 'totally protect our Asian American community.'
'Yes, it seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country,' he admitted.
'I don't like that at all. These are incredible people, they love our country and I'm not going to let it happen.'"

Menard, a 58-year-old Chinese American, said she didn't think twice before quipping, 'I'm having a wine.'
'I kind of thought he was an idiot,' Menard said.
'That's the kind of mentality that you walk around with, thinking that you're better than anybody else, and the way to make you feel better is to be nasty to other people. I think that's pretty sad.'
Menard, president of Chicago's chapter of the advocacy group OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates, said the tense environment reminds her of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act barring Chinese immigrants from entering the country, the first immigration law to exclude an ethnic group, as well as the World War II Japanese internment camps forcing Japanese Americans into incarceration.
'History is repeating itself,' Menard said.
'If we looked at the history of Asian Americans in the U.S., we've always been either held up as a model minority -- that despite the discrimination, we're still doing well -- or we're demonized because when something like this happens, it's all our fault.'"

The 30-year-old had just watched a movie at a Streeterville cinema with a friend on March 12 and was strolling down East Grand Avenue around 8 p.m., the two of them marveling at the deserted streets.
As they headed toward the Red Line station, Nguyen said a man walking nearby saw them and yelled out, 'F--- China!'
Then the man spat on Nguyen, he said.
The saliva splattered on his jacket.
Nguyen, who is of Vietnamese and Filipino descent, had imagined this moment.
Having read news stories about harassment and attacks against Asians as coronavirus cases rose, he wondered if he would be next.
If he was, he thought he would take a stand on behalf of himself and other Asians.
But as he wiped the saliva off with his sleeve, he and his friend -- of South Asian descent -- hurried away without a word to the assailant.
'In that instance, I was just kind of shocked, or dumbfounded, of what occurred,' Nguyen said.
But Nguyen fears it's too late.
Since the president and other politicians first used the term, Nguyen and other Asians in Chicago said they have felt growing apprehension that people take the president's comments as a license for racism."

'Got to get our masks on,' one of them said.
Tuyet Anh, who did not want her last name used, looked away.
One of the men wondered aloud, 'Oh, do you think she heard us?'
'I felt at first just very shocked,' Tuyet Anh said.
'Really? Someone would say that? But then processing it more, I just felt a little nervous and that feeling of being under surveillance, almost.'
Tuyet Anh, who is of Vietnamese descent, has since been saddened to read social media comments from her fellow classmates using the terms 'Chinese virus' and 'Wu flu.'
She wasn't surprised, given that the first phrase was picked up by Trump.
'It makes me and other Asian Americans feel as if we are the virus,' Tuyet Anh said.
'We are labeled and demonized as this threat to white American safety.'"

entity_32,Article_3,Sonny Vinuya,victim,Asian,"The Filipino American businessman in Las Vegas is personally offended by the president's use of a racist slur at recent reelection rallies, where he mocked China and the COVID-19 pandemic's origins in Asia.
Though it's tough for the registered Republican to swallow the racism against his own community, Vinuya said he doesn't think Trump is trying to alienate Asian American voters when the president uses derogatory terms at campaign events or continues to call COVID-19 the 'Chinese virus.'
For Vinuya, who has been courted by the Trump campaign as the president of the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce, he knows he could be one of the few Asian American voters nationally who can make a difference for the president's reelection prospects.
Vinuya said he's expressed his concerns about the anti-Asian slur to Trump's team, especially as he's trying to help his 600-plus members overcome the virus-related stigma and discrimination evident against Asian American and Asian immigrant small business owners in Las Vegas.
'I gave them my two cents. That's pretty much it,' Vinuya said. 'I don't want to waste my time on something I cannot control.'"
entity_33,Article_3,Karthick Ramakrishnan,professional,Asian,"With his anti-Asian rhetoric, Trump is making the calculation that he has more to gain with his loyal base of older white voters thrilled by his inflammatory statements than to lose among the Asian American community, said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy professor at the University of California, Riverside and founder of AAPI Data, which tracks Asian Americans.
That's because Asian Americans largely vote in very blue districts and otherwise non-competitive states, Ramakrishnan said.
'Part of the reason we don't see very much outreach is because Asian Americans tend to live in non-competitive states in presidential elections,' Ramakrishnan said.
In the top 10 states with the largest Asian American voting populations, Trump in 2016 won only Texas and Florida."

During the first week of the academic year at the Chicago high school where Chen works, which she requested to be unnamed for her privacy, three to four anonymous users logged into her Google classroom.

The school year, it's almost over, but I still have that trauma every time I open the link for my remote learning class.
This past Saturday, Chen, the Mandarin teacher from Bridgeport, stepped onto a bench at the foot of the Illinois Centennial Monument in Logan Square and peered out into the sea of hundreds of faces during a ""Stop Asian Hate"" rally.

Mr. Yang said Japanese Americans proved their loyalty and demonstrated our American-ness by serving in the military.
But the families of those who died in battle were still informed of their loss behind the barbed wire of American concentration camps.
More insidious was his promotion of the model minority myth.
Though Asian Americans are taking the brunt of the discrimination, immigrants have also been scapegoated, and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories abound about the spread of the coronavirus.
Mr. Yang bent over backward to sympathize with and excuse the behavior of people making such attacks and insisted that Asian Americans must disarm such racism by becoming more visibly American: 'We need to step up, help our neighbors, donate gear, vote, wear red white and blue, volunteer.'
Does Mr. Yang really believe that the 2-year-old Asian American girl and her 6-year-old sibling who were recently stabbed at a Sam's Club in Texas would have been spared if only they had been wearing more patriotic clothing?

Trump claims that in using the phrase 'Chinese virus,' he's just trying to be 'accurate' in describing where it's from.
In a time of unease and uncertainty, such language stokes xenophobic panic and doesn't get us closer to eradicating this virus.
Trump's rhetoric adds fuel to the growing fire of hatred being misdirected at Asian Americans.
The fact that he is the president of the United States, who is responsible for the well-being of all Americans, only makes his rhetoric even more disturbing.
Trump was asked on CNBC, 'Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?' He responded: 'No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control.'
The president's view that the virus was a Chinese problem contributed to his failure to understand the importance of testing people domestically for the virus and of having enough medical equipment to deal with the outbreak.

It was people's fear of coming to Manhattan's Chinatown, Chau believes, but also Asian families' fears of going out as they watched the coronavirus upend China's most important holiday.
It was fear, she says, of being punched, spat on or glared at because of her race or mask on the subway.
It was fear of bringing covid-19 to the older generation in an immigrant family's cramped apartment.
Each on its own was terrifying.
But the combination, the 56-year-old says, 'is just impossible.'
Now a banner on Chau's website declares that her decades-old Malaysian-French restaurant is ready to 'REOPEN!' - but staff who have to commute from outside the neighborhood won't come back yet to Aux Epices, Chau says, and she wakes up sweating from nightmares about crowds.
Chau's restaurant, Aux Epices, is a testament to the resilience of those immigrant communities on the brink - the culmination of years of passion and hardship overcome on the way to financial security in America.
Her restaurant's future, though, has never been more uncertain.
'Every day is a new day,' she said.
Chau thinks it's 'crazy' to reopen now even for takeout, with business still dismal and the pandemic raging.
But last week, she did it anyway.
'My heart wanted to come back,' Chau said.
A table at her entrance blocks people from coming too close in her narrow space, and she wears the face masks her staff had earlier abandoned as they heard about attacks on Asians with covered faces.
Chau says she's given up on a government loan - she has no borrowing history, and by the time she figured out the paperwork, her bank was swamped with demand, she said.
She listens all day to the news and wishes the president would spend more time talking about increased testing, the kind that might help her staff feel safe.

Victims said they were spat on, stabbed while shopping, shunned for wearing masks and barred from entering ride-hailing vehicles.
 Words matter. People are making that close association between the virus and Chinese people because he insisted on using that term, Jeung said.

Then the patient walked out of the ER.
In April, when Lim, dressed in a hazmat suit, was treating patients with covid-19 symptoms in a tent outside the main hospital, he said a man who had chest pain, difficulty breathing and a persistent cough declined Lim's assistance and returned to see the nurse who had taken his vitals.
That nurse, who was white, later told Lim that the patient said he did not want to be seen by an Asian provider because he thought he had contracted the coronavirus from a Chinese man coughing near him at a store, Lim recalled.
 I asked the nurse, 'Are you sure it was a Chinese man?' It's just stereotyping, assuming everyone who is Asian is Chinese and has coronavirus, Lim said.
He tried to treat the patient anyway, telling him that he was his only choice and that he would take care of him.
But the man left after spitting into a cup for the coronavirus test - and did not bother getting the X-ray or EKG that Lim had ordered for him.
Lim said he had never before encountered such discrimination during his 10 years in nursing, but it has become such a common experience among his Asian colleagues that he thought about quitting.
""Everybody is scared. I'm putting myself out there only to be treated this way. It's very disheartening,"" he said.
""We're not sick. You're the one who is sick, which is why you are here.
And you are exposing us as the health-care provider taking care of you, and we are treated as though we are the ones carrying the coronavirus."""

He followed her and continued yelling racial epithets.
Zhang said the encounter shook her, affecting her ability to focus on her work at the start of her shift.

Cruz told the patient that she is Filipina, to which she said the patient replied: ""Wow. I can't believe what your people did. I usually wouldn't choose an Asian doctor, but you seem nice.""
Cruz quickly ended the visit.
The incident inspired her to join more than a dozen other doctors in producing an #iamnotavirus video to help combat the wave of bigotry against Asians.

 Words matter. People are making that close association between the virus and Chinese people because he insisted on using that term, Jeung said.

And when doctors and nurses leave the hospital, they face increasing harassment in their daily lives, too.

Her mother and other relatives who moved to the United States after the 1975 fall of Saigon found employment in a beauty industry that's open to immigrants with limited English but involves constant exposure to noxious chemicals, with modest remuneration.
""They worked for us so we could do something else,"" says Wills, 39, on the phone from Denver.
""There was almost a shame of what they did, which I felt.
I hope my mom knows it's not a shame.""
The pandemic devastated small-business owners like Wills, who was forced to shutter two salons in Southern California and saw revenue plummet 80 percent.
""All of our lives fell apart,"" says Wills, a mother of four.
To Wills, Atlanta was not a matter of if but when.
""Before I read past the headline, I knew what had happened.
I knew it was going to be Asian American women who were killed,"" she says.
""I saw my own face, my daughters, my mother, my grandmothers, my aunties, my sisters, my staff, my friends,"" she posted on Instagram.
""I am profoundly sad, scared, furious with rage and simply just heart broken.""
""My face is Asian.
It doesn't matter what I own or what I do,"" she says.
""I am a target.
That is the reality.
I'm terrified for me.
I'm terrified for my workers.""
She starts to quietly weep.
""I've had people move away from me in stores to another line,"" she says.
One client requested a nail technician who wasn't Asian American.
She was told to get her nails polished elsewhere.
""I still feel very invisible in an industry dominated by Asian American women.
I get left out of conversations,"" Wills says.
Until it was called out earlier this year on social media, Nailpro magazine didn't include a single Asian American on its 14-member advisory board.
The industry is three-quarters immigrant - and 76 percent of that group is Asian, according to a 2018 study, and predominantly Vietnamese in California.
""Most of our culture tells us to put your head down and keep moving forward and stay out of the limelight.
They don't want the attention.
They just don't want the negativity,"" Wills says.
Since the shootings, she has placed additional Mace canisters in her salons.
Wills restricted patronage to appointments only, with no foot traffic to purchase products, which will further reduce revenue.
She's already operating at 50 percent occupancy, following state guidelines.
Wills is also considering active-shooter training for her staff.
In eight years of operating nail salons, this was never on her to-do list.
Her escalating fears are shared by other Asian Americans in her industry."

It will remain locked until the door can be installed and she feels safe that her salon won't be a target.

It wasn't until she was a student at Harvard, volunteering in Chinatown at the Asian American Civic Association, that she felt truly connected to the pieces of her identity she had to code-switch growing up.
In February 2020, as Chinatown was being crushed by xenophobia, Wu co-hosted a dim sum brunch at China Pearl to combat the stigma.

When Su moved to Arlington from Texas in 2013, she noticed how teachers were confusing her daughter, a preschooler then, with the other Asian student in her class.
I was very much ashamed of being Taiwanese American because that is what I was taught by all of the implicit messages growing up.
Su had to put in self-work to gain confidence and examine how her insecurity around her identity stemmed from how Asian Americans are deemed outsiders.
The recent rise in violence against Asian Americans, has been a reminder of the source of that fear.
It's brought to light how Asian Americans can be so easily demonized as the perpetual foreigners.
We can be so quickly blamed as having been the cause of this pandemic and therefore any anger can be directed toward Asians and justified."

Exploring Chinatown and Quincy, breathing in the cultural celebration, gave him a sense of pride.
To be Asian American is to be stuck in between,' said Tom, 28, a Somerville public relations associate.
I often feel like I am not American enough to be American.
People readily assume I don't speak English.
I was an Eagle Scout whose grandfather fought in the Korean War for the United States.
He's cautious about leaving the house.
Early on in the pandemic, his brother was spat on while running in Philly.
For him, whether we are talking about the Hell's Canyon Massacre of 1887, the vicious murder of Vincent Chin in 1982, or the recent violent attacks against Asians in America, it's related.

Around that same time, she was called the N-word for the first time.
A Black woman who is also Chinese, Miller said stereotypes about Asians make people think they can get away with hate and violence.
And anti-Blackness in America affects everything.
There's this idea of Asians being submissive, quiet, and nonthreatening.
At the same time the model minority myth aligns Asians with whiteness.
It's fragmenting us.
We are all fighting systemic racism.
But to tear down these barriers we have to also talk about anti-Blackness in the Asian community.
For Miller, these are her identities.
Colonialism is so indoctrinated in America,' said Miller, 29, a Boston digital marketer.

To open the door for conversation, Lee drove her kids by a recent rally for Asian Americans in Wellesley, where they live.
Then at bedtime, Lee explained a little more about what's happening in the world.
âWe talk about why equality is so important and how the color of your skin shouldn't matter, but not everyone thinks that way,â said Lee, a medical devices executive.
It's a conversation her parents did not have with her."
entity_599,Article_50,Christine Koh,other_individuals,Asian,"For Christine Koh, a Korean American and coauthor of Minimalist Parenting, the topic of inclusivity â whether race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion â has always been part of her conversations with her daughters, 10 and 16.
But the tone and focus began to change after Trump's election in 2016 and in the early days of the pandemic, when Koh herself could feel growing anti-Asian hostility in society.
A year ago, before masks were mandatory, she felt self-conscious wearing a face covering fearing it would highlight her Asian-ness.
Koh, who lives in the Boston area, began to speak more directly about Asian racism with her daughters, especially her teenager, who has a cellphone and is plugged into the news.
Koh's message is simple: If someone says something mean, don't suffer in silence, and always know Mom and Dad are here to support you.
âThere is a shame piece that is deeply rooted that keeps people quiet,â said Koh.
âYou think it's your fault.â
Koh and her family experienced countless acts of racism in Belmont, where she grew up from the 1970s to 1990s, and in Jamaica Plain where her parents owned a convenience store.
Koh recalls one incident around age 7 in Belmont, when she was out walking with her mother and felt the pelt of a hard object and a spray of cold liquid, followed by an epithet (âTake that chinks!â) coming from a group of teenagers in a moving car.
Her second message to her daughters is to be aware of their surroundings."

Tran, who grew up in Dorchester and is not related to Thomas Tran, has tolerated racist taunts throughout her life, hurled at the most mundane moments, such as one at a gas station where a white man told her: âGook, go back to where you come from.â
But as any parent can attest, it's different when your child experiences that pain of living in an ugly world.
After the Atlanta murders, her 12-year-old son, Kenneth, who dealt with bullying at a previous school, felt unsafe.
âI didn't want to go outside without a grown-up,â he said.
After Atlanta, Hanh Tran gives voices to what so many Asian Americans are thinking: âAre you serious? I thought it would change. It did not change at all.â
âI tell my family in Vietnam: You come to America. You think it's peaceful. You're living the life. It's really not,â said Tran, who lost her airline job during the pandemic and now is going back to school."

The incident took place in broad daylight near a busy playground, but no one offered to help her as she sat on the curb, clutching a tissue to her bleeding head, Shen said.
Recalling the attack later, Shen said she felt like the 65-year-old Filipino woman in New York City whose brutal beating just one day before hers was caught on video as security guards in a nearby building watched and locked the doors.
'People usually jump to help someone if they have fallen down,' said Shen.
'It's as if we are not seen as really belonging to American society, so it feels OK to treat us differently.'
As infuriating as the incident was, Shen said what made her even more mad was this: The racist assault took place in front of a bus stop in Medford where a dozen people were waiting.
'Nobody did anything,' Shen recalled.
Shen's experiences were never captured in police logs because she, like many Asian Americans, are reluctant to report a hate crime.
Shen, the woman who was shoved to the ground in Medford, still does not feel comfortable reporting the assault to the police."

As an activist for the Asian American community in the Upstate, Wu hopes his story will break down the barriers of racism and xenophobia that have plagued the Asian and Asian-American communities for hundreds of years.
Georgia law enforcement officials say the murderer was not motivated by racism, but many, including Wu, dispute that claim.
 I believe (the suspect) to be a racist, but also misogynist, Wu said in a YouTube video posted to nonprofit Votes for Vets' YouTube page.

Chinese were most targeted, then Korean, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Japanese.
 Rather than accept the premise that we're against one another...

They didn't have to say that.
They didn't have to do that.
But they did.
And because of what they did many of us, including my own family, is in the United States.
So we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to those Civil Rights leaders because without them we wouldn't be there.
So let's think about that and think about how we work together toward solutions rather than accept the premise of white supremacy that is 'let's pit these groups against each other'.
We have so much in common and we can work together for the right restorative and transformative justice solutions.

'I know this will disappoint some of you but I am not naming or shaming anyone,' Lin wrote on Twitter Saturday morning.
'What good does it do for someone in this situation to be torn down?'
The former Knicks sensation, 32, who is trying to resurrect his career in the G league bubble with the Golden State Warriors affiliate, revealed the 'coronavirus' incident in a Facebook post Thursday that detailed the fight against prejudice encountered by himself and other Asian Americans.
'Being a 9 year NBA veteran doesn't protect me from being called 'coronavirus' on the court,' Lin wrote.
'Being a man of faith doesn't mean I don't fight for justice, for myself and for others.'
The G League was looking into the claim but Lin said he doesn't see the benefit of outing the alleged offender.
'It doesn't make my community safer or solve any of our long-term problems with racism,' he wrote.
Lin has long been outspoken about being the subject of stereotypes, but over the last year verbal and physical attacks on Asian Americans have become more prevalent because the pandemic started in China.
'We are tired of being told that we don't experience racism, we are tired of being told to keep our heads down and not make trouble,' Lin wrote.
'We are tired of Asian American kids growing up and being asked where they're REALLY from, of having our eyes mocked, of being objectified as exotic or being told we're inherently unattractive.
We are tired of the stereotypes in Hollywood affecting our psyche and limiting who we think we can be.
We are tired of being invisible, of being mistaken for our colleague or told our struggles aren't as real.'
Lin was the first American-born NBA player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent when he played for the Warriors in 2010-11.
He then signed in New York and became a household name with the birth of Linsanity.
Lin bounced around the league for much of the decade, including two seasons in Brooklyn, and played in China last season.
In five games with the Santa Cruz Warriors of the G League, Lin is averaging 19.6 points and 7.2 assists in 31.3 minutes."

Dumplings made by hand, it only takes a few minutes to eat them, so you have to constantly be making them all day.""
Maintaining pleasantries to abide by the holiday spirit of prosperity was a must, Ng said.
""There was always good conversations and never bad words spoken,"" she said, adding it's ""bad luck"" to spoil the positive vibes.
The pandemic has prompted Ng to pivot away from face-to-face celebrations like cooking traditional meals with relatives and attending lion dances, in which performers wear an elaborate, colorful head ornament and move to the rhythms of drumbeats, in Chinatown in Manhattan.
Instead, Ng plans to attend a virtual celebration and video chat with college classmates who live abroad in countries like Singapore and Japan.
The 2021 Lunar New Year takes on even more significance in the effort to move on from an uptick in hate-related crimes and reports of discrimination against Asians, Ng said.
She had one such negative encounter last winter at a Rocky Point grocery store.
It occurred before masks became a common protective measure.
Ng said a woman stared at her and then pulled her scarf over her nose and mouth.
She hasn't experienced another similar interaction since, but the moment stuck with her, said Ng, who was born in Hong Kong and emigrated to the United States when she was a child.

""I only realized it when I started to think about all the rhetoric that was going on and why people would do something like that.
For a while, it made me a little angry.""

""When you were a little child, you never had your own money.
Receiving hongbao was exciting.
It didn't happen at any other time of the year.
It didn't even happen during Christmas.""
Quan, 39, doesn't remember what he did with the money.
What he does remember is taking the crisp bills out of the envelopes, putting them in a pile and counting them before putting the money away in a shoebox under his bed.
""As a child, I didn't have a job.
I didn't get an allowance, Quan said.

The woman then launched into a coronavirus tirade -- she had stayed at home for a year and done everything right, yet ""a foreigner"" gave her the virus.
Tang's anger rose as she found herself at that well-trodden crossroad faced by anyone targeted because of race, gender, sexual orientation or religion: Stay quiet, or say or do something and possibly risk an escalation?
For many Asian Americans, from immigrants to fifth generation, incidents like the one Tang endured have been an all too normal part of their lives -- usually not rising to physical attacks but feeling at times like a window into a deeper well of hate.
Inside the elevator, others chimed in and said that COVID had been ""brought here."" Tang decided to say something.
""I would like you to know that I'm vaccinated,"" said Tang, who wanted the woman to hear that she spoke English fluently and without an accent.
 I wasn't going to get into a fight in an elevator with this woman, but it was very clear to me that in her eyes, I was a foreigner, Tang, 48, who is Chinese American, said later.
Tang, the author of a world affairs book, has endured racist incidents on a weekly basis, even before the pandemic.
Once, a group of tourists pulled her out of a cab while telling her to ""go back to squatting on the ground in my pajamas in China.""
Another time, a woman shoved her off a subway train onto the platform and called her a derogatory term for Chinese people.
Countless times as she walks down the street, men have shouted, ""Me love you long time,"" ""Ching chong ni hao"" or ""Konichiwa"" and then, when ignored, followed up with expletives.
A month ago, a woman spit on her in a restaurant bathroom, saying she didn't ""want to get the coronavirus.""
 I think you take it incident by incident. You try to assess whether it's worth it to fight back, whether it's worth it to say something, Tang said.
""I have yelled back at racist slurs on the street. When people say things to me, especially if they assume I don't speak English, I have some choice words for them.""
But to respond every time would feel akin to living in a constant state of combat.
 If you've been going through this for decades, you go through periods where you're really angry, periods where you're resigned, then you're really angry again, then you're resigned, Tang said.

The man seemed friendly at first, so she responded that she was in her 20s.
The man told her she looked like she was 2.
""You can never tell with you Chinese people,"" he said.
""I'm actually not Chinese,"" said Kim, who is Korean, reflexively correcting him.
""You're lying. You're Chinese. You have COVID,"" he told her.
""Don't ever take your mask off because you'll give us all COVID.""
As Kim walked away, the man screamed after her, calling her a ""b--"" and threatening to cut off all her hair.
""I almost want to just hide and not say anything or just like not be part of the situation anymore,"" said Kim, who ignores and avoids eye contact with strangers on the street who have greeted her with ""Ni hao"" -- ""How are you?"" in Mandarin.
""I guess I sort of was taught that reacting with anger or anything will make the situation worse.""
What weighed on the 25-year-old the rest of the day was not just the interaction with the stranger but the remarks from friends and acquaintances over the years that she had previously convinced herself were harmless.
 If someone said something racist against Asians in the past, I think I would just laugh it off, I guess, move on, and just like hold your anger for later,"" she said.

She choked up at the thought: ""Asian Americans are taught not to take up space or talk about ourselves too much.
When some of us do speak up, it feels like no one is listening.
In the past, it has been easy to bury her head in the sand, she said, because horrifying racist attacks weren't happening directly to her or on her block.
As she gets older, that's harder to do, she said.
""I was scared of it happening, and it finally did happen, but just not to me.
And it's not any better,"" she said.
And she knows it could happen to her.
""You're carrying this feeling of inevitability,"" she said.
Nguyen Bradley said she's worried about her immigrant Vietnamese parents and finds it hard to broach the subject of racism in light of the Atlanta attacks.
They have mostly been staying home during the pandemic -- her father is recovering from COVID-19.
But she worries about the moments they have to leave their house in a mostly white Pittsburgh neighborhood.
""Of course, I'm worried if they go to Walmart or that kind of thing,"" she said.
""Asian kids, we don't want our parents to worry.
We see how far we can get without talking to them about it.""
As for herself, Nguyen Bradley started taking precautions early last year, considering the racist rhetoric at the start of the pandemic, but has since let go a little.
She would avoid walking her dog or getting the mail at night, asking her husband to do the tasks instead.
She would clench her phone in her pocket while she was out and about, ready to call someone or take photos if she needed to.
But now, she's exhausted.
""I can barely get out of bed,"" she said.

""We span all different parts of an entire continent.
My entire life I've seen my elders and peers being treated less than because of their slanted eyes and for not properly pronouncing a word correctly because English is their second or third language!?
I'm telling you right now, this and future generations of Asian Americans will not allow this hate to proceed.""
It's probably not the most strategic move to be so open about her beliefs on social media, and people send her direct messages telling her so, she said.
But she doesn't care.
She wants people to know what is happening in her community, especially white folks who make up much of the vegan community and her following.
She writes from the safety of her computer, a privilege her immigrant parents didn't have.
When she heard the news Wednesday morning about the attacks on Asian women in Atlanta, she felt surprised that she was so affected because it was so distant from her.
But the moment has caused memories of racism to bubble up and moved her to take a stand.
Estrada said she remembered people calling her Chinese as a kid and laughing, as though it were an insult, even though she is Filipina.
Her parents didn't teach her Tagalog for fear of her becoming alienated from her peers.
They never gave her homemade lunches to take to school -- they packed Lunchables instead, so she could be like everyone else.
When she got old enough to date, she remembers being keenly aware of the fetishization of young Asian women.
She made an effort to be loud and vocal, to avoid being seen as submissive and targeted by men.
She avoided dating white men.
It comes as no surprise to her, then, that investigators claimed race was not a factor in the Atlanta attacks and that the suspect claimed to have a sex addiction.
""To me, it's quite obvious it was racially motivated,"" she said.
In the last year, she experienced a rise in disturbing encounters with strangers, she said.
One time, someone pushed her off a sidewalk.
On another day, a man flipped her off as he drove past her.
Her partner, who is also Filipino, has been told to go back to his country several times.
Despite years of racism in her own life, this is a ""lightbulb"" moment, she said.
""I have always experienced some sort of anti-Asian hate in my life, but growing up I didn't see it as hate.
I saw it as people making fun of me and my parents,"" she said.
""I accepted that 'Asians look funny.' There's a lot of unlearning to be done.""
Estrada said that until now she hadn't thought much about her safety as a young Asian American business owner.
She's worried more for her mother, who works as a bank teller and has had racist encounters her whole life in public spaces.
Estrada said she probably won't be talking to her parents about her fears or the violence, though.
It's a ""tricky"" conversation because of differing political views between generations, she said."

After the killing of eight people, including six Asian women, she and the other therapists in her Los Angeles-area practice were virtually flooded with calls and emails from would-be clients.
Ninety percent of them were Asian people mentioning the shooting or racial trauma.
The out-of-state inquiries were not new for Yoon, who started the Yellow Chair Collective with a partner in 2019.
But due to overwhelming demand and licensing restrictions that limit practitioners' ability to treat people in other states, Yoon and her fellow therapists felt a sense of helplessness, realizing they could not serve everyone.
 We've been getting a lot more inquiries than we could accommodate, Yoon said.
""We've been getting a lot of inquiries out of state where they don't have a lot of Asian providers and that's been hard ... we had to turn some Asian clients away.""
Yoon had to find a therapist for her mom in 2019 when she was experiencing depression.
Given her background, Yoon said she did the therapist consultations and made the appointments.
Yoon said it's common to see young Asian people asking for a consultation or making appointments on behalf of their parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles.
 Because of their generation, therapy wasn't even an option, they didn't think about it, Yoon said.
""They're still hesitant, so younger people are trying to bring that idea to their parents.""
To meet the increased need of the community, Yoon and her staff initially offered two free support groups after the Atlanta-area shootings.
They filled up quickly.
But Yoon says her Asian clients are struggling to process what happened in the Atlanta area and the attacks that have long occurred in their communities.
Often they've been told by older generations to ignore the racist attacks, work harder and ""don't rock the boat, Yoon said.
Now they're trying to find the words to explain the traumas of feeling culturally and emotionally invisible.
 A lot of them were telling me that a lot of companies didn't acknowledge what happened, Yoon said of her clients.
""They're feeling the tragedy but their companies, their own managers, are going like it's just a normal day and that was on St. Patrick's Day so people were celebrating ... they're really struggling, and they feel like they want to cry and it's like, 'OK, when I go to therapy, I can cry.' """

The principal called her into his office.
The three boys who had painted the racist message were there, too, and apologized to her.
They were friends of her opponent.
But that only made the incident scarier.
'I was just like, 'Why am I, a short, small, Asian girl alone in an office with a big, tall, white, male principal and three other big, tall, white guys, all jocks, who basically just threatened me?' All I wanted to do was get out of there as fast as I could,' she said.
'It was so intimidating and frightening to be alone in that situation.'
The boys were not severely punished, she said.
Montano, who is half- Filipino and half-Thai, won the election.

They drove away, with Montano crying in the backseat.
'That was one of the scariest moments of my childhood, to know that these men wanted to kill us just because of the way we looked,' she said.
She was 13 or 14 at the time.
In her Los Angeles neighborhood a few weeks ago, an unmasked woman breathed in Montano's face, then leaned into her 8-year-old son's face and said in a snide tone, 'Oh, aren't you cute?'
Montano didn't say anything.
She was too shocked.
And she second-guessed her instinct that the woman's behavior was racially motivated.
'I can never prove to anyone that it was racist without her hurling racial slurs at us, but you have to wonder: Would she have done that to us if I was a man? Would she have done that to me if I was white like her?' said Montano, an actress and voice-over artist.

Like Tan most of the victims of the shooting attacks were of Asian descent drawing new attention to an ongoing wave of hate crimes against Asian Americans across the country fueled by racism and xenophobia amid the COVID-19 outbreak and anti-China rhetoric expressed by many conservative leaders including former President Donald Trump.
In China it is customary to put the family name before the given name.
Tan's name in Chinese transliterated to Tan Xiao Jie which means pure or honest.
However because Western countries use the surname last her legal name in the United States is Xiaojie Tan.

In recent months, people of Asian descent – not just Chinese Americans – have been shunned, verbally abused, name-called, coughed and spat on, even physically assaulted, said Russell Jeung, chair of the Asian American Studies Department at San Francisco State University who’s been studying bias-related incidents against Asian Americans during the coronavirus epidemic.
Jeung, the San Francisco State professor, said there are several reasons why people may not want to report to police.
Many Asian Americans are culturally reticent to deal with the government, he said.
Some fled authoritarian regimes from their home countries and are inherently distrustful of authority.
Some also came to the United States illegally and are fearful of calling attention to themselves.
Language barriers can also be an issue.
Jeung and two advocacy groups in California recently launched a website allowing people to report incidents anonymously.
They have received 673 responses over the past week from across the country, many of which came from New York and California, where majority of the United States’ Asian populations live, according to their report.
The incidents involved not only Chinese Americans, but also Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese, Vietnamese and Filipinos – a clear case of racial profiling against Asian Americans, Jeung said."

Harassment and other bias-related incidents have 'put enough fear into them that they felt like they needed to arm themselves to protect themselves and their families,' Mylett said.
But despite the abundance of anecdotal evidence reported in the media and by advocacy groups, many police departments, including Mylett’s, said they have not seen any significant uptick in the number of hate-crime reports related to COVID-19.
This suggests that people may be hesitant, if not fearful, to go to police.
That’s a concern for Mylett.
Hate crimes normally start as aggressive comments that don’t rise to the level of a crime before they escalate into physical violence, he said.
So the earlier law enforcement can intervene, then hopefully we’ll be able to prevent somebody (from) being victimized and somebody making a decision that will land them in jail for a long time, Mylett said."

entity_2010,Article_631,"Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif.",politician,Asian,"Speaking at a virtual press conference, Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chairperson Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., said the Asian American community had 'reached a crisis point that cannot be ignored' amid reports of a rise in violence and hate incidents against Asian Americans in the last several weeks.
Chu and other lawmakers said the attacks are part of a rise in anti-Asian American bias and xenophobia amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
'What started as dirty looks and verbal assaults' at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic had 'escalated to physical attacks and violence against innocent Asian Americans,' Chu said.
'Just as many Asian Americans were preparing for the Lunar New Year over the past few weeks, we saw a surge in anti-Asian violence.'
Chu cited several attacks against Asian Americans, including the killing of 84-year-old Thai American Vicha Ratanapakdee, and a recent increase in violence against senior citizens in Oakland, Calif.'s, Chinatown.
In response, Chu and the lawmakers called for Congress to take action to pass the 'No Hate Act,' which would provide grants to states to improve hate crime reporting.

'I just came back from China in January. If you're scared of me, get up and leave.'
I bit my lips to stop the trembling.
This past month, I've made less eye contact with people when I've walked outside.
When I felt like coughing, I smothered the urge by biting my tongue.
When I went to shake someone's hand at a party, I instinctively scanned their arm for the tiniest jerk back, a moment of hesitation.
The awareness of my being the only Chinese person sat heavier in my gut than anything I ate at lunch.
It dawned on me: Sensational reporting and social media were making fear more contagious than the virus itself.
I realized my friends in the United States read only the headlines about the coronavirus but knew nothing about the stories behind them.
They didn't hear from our family friend whose mother, a doctor, flew from Guangdong Province to Wuhan to volunteer with thousands of other hospital workers.
They didn't see the lines etched into doctors' and nurses' faces from wearing face masks and goggles nonstop for weeks.
After I rushed home from the nail salon that day, my mother and I called the owner.
I brought up a report by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention: It had the Covid-19 fatality rate at 2.3 percent.
We also talked about how perpetuating harmful stereotypes that Chinese people eat 'weird' food can be detrimental not just to Chinese people but also to all Asians.
My voice a little unsteady, I shared with the women that the incident in the salon left me shaky for the rest of the day.
That by nighttime, my anger had melted away to tears, leaving me collapsed on the couch.
But something haunted me more than the nail technician's rant: The silence in the room when everyone heard it.
In my family people call me the pit bull because I'm the first to fight back if someone attacks my people.
In the one moment I tried and failed to be my own pit bull, no one stepped in to be mine.
At the end of our conversation, there was a brief silence, and then a woman stepped forward.
She said quietly: 'This has happened to me too. People said bad things to me, too, because of virus.'
I have a little brother I want to protect and parents who I hope can walk into a store and not be made to feel inhuman.

What Trump did is that he weaponized it in a way, Ramakrishnan said.
Trump's rhetoric helps set a certain narrative in place - and presidents have an outsized role in terms of shaping narrative.
They don't call it a bully pulpit for nothing, and especially Trump, the way he frequently used Twitter as well as press conferences and off-the-cuff remarks to campaign rallies to frame the narrative in a particular way, it likely played a role, Ramakrishnan added.
A separate study revealed that the use of China virus language to refer to the coronavirus, particularly by GOP officials and conservative outlets, has already resulted in a shift in how many people in the US perceive Asian Americans.
Many outlets have attributed the attacks to rhetoric that Trump used during his tenure."

What Trump did is that he weaponized it in a way, Ramakrishnan said.
Ramakrishnan explained that research on Trump's use of racist language in reference to other groups shows that his language did have a profound impact on how people behave toward marginalized groups.
There's a complex variety of factors, but the fundamental reality is that there's an increase in the number of Asian Americans who feel unsafe, he stated.
He added more data on the current situation will become available in another year, and until then, it's difficult to definitively declare that there's been an increase in hate crimes of late.
It's possible, Ramakrishnan said, that what Asian Americans were going through a year ago was just as bad or worse but failed to receive the kind of media attention they're getting now.
He also said there's likely a confluence of factors that have contributed to the recent attacks on elders, and it cannot be neatly summed up by solely the heightened anti-Asian sentiment witnessed throughout the pandemic.
Ramakrishnan added there could be a combination of the effects of poverty and financial struggle as well as opportunity at play.
Not everyone reacts to economic deprivation in the same way.
And even if someone wants to do something, they might not find the opportunity to do it.
So in some ways, Asian elders seem to be softer targets than others for this activity, he continued.
The availability of vaccines for older people, along with Lunar New Year festivities and shopping, could have contributed to more older Asian Americans being out in the community, Ramakrishnan said.
And many of the older victims were attacked in areas that had already struggled prior to the pandemic and were hit particularly hard by the economic impacts of the virus.
""Many of these Chinatowns are in places that are low income and also suffering economically.
So that might be one set of explanations as to why this phenomenon is taking this particular shape,"" he stated, adding, ""On top of that, we live in an age of viral social media, and ... especially the shock value of some of these videos increases awareness and maybe anxiety in the community."""

I do realize that I may be in a minority here, so I feel lucky.
As of now, I am not afraid of being bullied or attacked because I am Asian, but I am definitely more aware and untrusting towards the public.
Unfortunately, I do not think stopping Asian hate or really any type of hate is possible, as there will always be people who are unaccepting or scared of outsiders.
The best we can do is bring attention to the problem and try to fix issues in our local communities in order to enact widespread change and allow Asians to feel safe.
I find it frustrating that people always find scapegoats for their problems instead of facing their issues head-on.
The adults of this world should not act like young children who have a simplistic and childish vendetta against people who haven’t done anything directly to them."
entity_2422,Article_98,Justine Schulke,victim,Cannot be inferred,"People may think that Anti-Asian violence started because of the coronavirus — since it originated in China — but racism against Asians Americans has existed in our country for years.
Though I’ve never experienced anti-Asian racism directly, I’ve consumed the recent attacks through the media and from my family’s experiences.
The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement shed light on how systematic racism exists, and has always existed, in our country.
I’m not surprised to know something like hate crimes are now skyrocketing against the Asian community, but it’s frustrating to see how so many people continue to be so ignorant and heinous, hating and abusing our elders for something they haven’t done.
There are notions that Asians aren’t truly American.
The news of these attacks have not had a significant effect on my day to day life, but I now carry a keychain with an alarm just in case, and I’m not allowed to take the subway.
I feel extremely safe at school.
My school has been implementing many conversations on race, racism and what we need to do as a school and community to be anti-racist.
However, in public, there is a subconscious thought in the back of my head whether I might be the next Asian American involved in a hate crime.
I think the first step to stopping the hate is to acknowledge that there are hate crimes happening against the Asian community.
Secondly, we need to address this issue to the school, or if you’re uncomfortable, to spread awareness on social media and to your friends.
Further, we should talk about these violent attacks within the school community, at a workplace, or wherever you are to denounce anti-Asian racism.
Finally, we need to get involved, whether that be attending protests, handing out fliers, supporting Asian owned businesses, reporting hate crimes, condemning hate, and combating the prejudice and bigotry of the connection between Asians and Covid-19."
entity_2423,Article_98,Megan Kwan,victim,Asian,"I’m absolutely disgusted by recent attacks on Asian Americans.
Why is it that murder needs to occur before the world recognizes the discrimination against Asians every day?
I hate how people are excusing their actions with trivial excuses.
I hate how people are just now trying to stop the hate.
Although support is always welcome, it should not have had to take death to finally get the media’s attention and for people to realize just how normalized these attacks are.
I fear for the safety of my family and others.
I should not be scared that my grandmother might get beaten every time she goes to Chinatown, or that my sister will be called racist names when she goes back to school.
Fear is just the beginning of it.
It also affects me due to the media attention it’s received recently.
Everywhere I see people arguing online because someone is so uneducated that they believe it is called the ‘Chinese virus’ because it’s from China.
I want people to stand up for Asians because they recognize that we are being harassed and assaulted.
I want them to realize that asking if someone has eaten a dog before is just as racist and harmful as the attacks you see on the news.
I am scared of what would happen at school.
Although I’ve never experienced bullying before, I’m deathly afraid of the harassment I might receive if I go back.
Before Corona, there were multiple instances of racism at my school, and I fully believe that it would increase.
Such as people only grouping me with Asians because we’re the same, people telling me I have small eyes, people mocking my food, asking if I eat dogs, etc.
I’m not very strong or athletic, so If I was attacked I would have no way of defending myself which is incredibly scary considering I walked home from school alone each day last year.
I believe that we need to teach the next generation that any type of racism is offensive and should not be normalized.
I’ve had many experiences that most minorities can relate to, not just Asians.
Most notably bringing a school lunch, in which one brings a school lunch of food usually from their culture.
That’s when all the other kids gather around to stare and criticize the way it smells or looks.
Almost every minority I’ve met has experienced this, and it should be stopped.
Just because it doesn’t look ‘American’ doesn’t mean it isn’t normal in any way.
Another thing that needs to change is stereotypes.
Not all Asians are smart, good at math, play the violin, grow up to be a doctor, or are bad drivers.
We’ve achieved the status of ‘good’ minorities who don’t cause trouble and are smart reliable citizens.
In Washington, they even changed our status from a minority to White.
I am not Caucasian so do not compare me to one as if it were a compliment.
Being Asian is part of my identity and by you taking that away from me is racism in its greatest form."
entity_2424,Article_98,Olivia Quan,victim,Asian,"I know about all of the Asian hate crimes that have been going around, and I know for a fact that it’s serious and hurtful to many.
I unfortunately have experienced Asian hate.
This was before the whole lockdown thing.
My teachers were wiping down all of our desks, and a boy shouted in the class something along the lines of ‘You should clean Olivia because she’s Asian so she has corona.’
Sometimes, I do feel afraid if I get bullied at school as an Asian.
I know it could help if people are educated about what Asian hate is about and how it affects people.
Or people need to learn how not to be a jerk."
entity_2425,Article_98,Jack C.,victim,Cannot be inferred,"I have heard of the attacks going on for Asian hate.
This is a problem that has to be stopped.
Similar to attacks on African American people, this is a big problem and doesn’t reflect well for the U.S, especially when we are the ‘Land of the Free.’
It’s not just bad for Asian Americans, but also for the entire United States because it impacts what other people think of our country.
The attacks have not affected my life a lot.
I live in a small town, so I know a lot of people in my town.
I don’t get afraid of being bullied, because my school has generally been accepting, and I know I have friends that would stand with me.
I also don’t go outside of my town a lot because of Covid.
Educating can help stop Asian hate, as well as hate for other minorities and groups.
Though it is nearly impossible for everybody to be anti-racist, we can help some people not be racist by educating them about racism.
Just like people say we should learn about WWII or any other historical event to not repeat our mistakes, if we learn about racism, we can help not repeat mistakes in our society."
entity_2426,Article_98,Olivia Wong,victim,Asian,"I am aware of the growing violence against Asian Americans, and I feel so disheartened that this is what’s happening in our country.
It feels as if there are so many divisions separating people in a nation that is supposed to be united.
During a pandemic where so many have been suffering all over the world for a year now, Asians have been wrongly scapegoated, and as a result, innocent people are being attacked, especially the elderly.
Fortunately, I have not encountered firsthand any verbal or physical assaults due to my race at school or around the neighborhood.
However, there are people I know who do not know the extent of their words and make jokes at the expense of others, repeating phrases like ‘the Chinese virus’ or ‘Kung Flu.’
Not only does this rhetoric harm victims’ mental health, but it also leads to more serious issues when it turns out that those words weren’t just joking.
It is understandable that people have feelings of frustration and fear, but it is unacceptable when they choose to take them out on Asian Americans.
My entire family is also passionate about this lingering issue.
My parents have gotten stares and have been yelled at while shopping or taking a walk, and one of my brothers was on the receiving end of a terrible verbal assault while working in a grocery store over the summer.
I have not been restricted in going out, but I am on high alert to watch for my surroundings.
I feel safe in my school because the faculty promotes inclusion, fosters conversations, and is not afraid of educating us on current social and political issues.
I am not afraid for myself, but more for my own grandparents since the majority of attacks have targeted the elderly.
If we want change, we must continue to speak out because these attacks are not stopping anytime soon.
We have a responsibility to not stay silent in order to educate our fellow Americans on the strength of their words and the power of their actions.
If we do our part, more and more people will become aware of our situation and begin to actively learn about the ongoing virus of racism."
entity_2427,Article_98,Hannah,victim,Cannot be inferred,"Ever since COVID started, I had already noticed the uptick in hate crimes against Asian Americans and how they mostly went unnoticed with the news barely covering these attacks.
It made me terrified to go outside for a walk or to get groceries with my family being fully aware that I could easily get caught up in one of those events.
The growing news and coverage over the last year of these attacks has made me pretty self-conscious about every little thing I do.
Every time I’m out somewhere public or in school, I feel like I’m being judged every step I take, and it’s agonizing.
Before I went back to school, I do specifically remember talking to my mom about how I was scared that someone was going to bully me at school or say something passive-aggressive and that in the end I wouldn’t know how to react.
I still feel that way.
Whenever someone is whispering to someone else or staring at me in public or at school, I think the worst.
I think that they’re making a snide remark about my race and it makes me anxious.
In my opinion, I know it’s impossible to completely stop racism, but we can start by not blaming a single race for everything that’s going on now.
It’s just not right."
entity_2428,Article_98,Alexis Quan,victim,Asian,"I am aware of the anti-Asian attacks that have been going on the news more recently and when COVID-19 first struck.
I do not like seeing the acts of violence and hearing of the verbal tirades someone says against the Asian community.
It makes me feel disturbed that people are going out of their way to harm others simply of the color of their skin.
It makes me feel unsafe.
I’d rather not have to go outside and deal with someone yelling at me for ‘carrying the virus’ when I have my mask on and they do not.
I am not afraid of being bullied at school.
I have a good support system of friends there who I know will stand up for me.
In the beginning of the pandemic, I was afraid that some people would do the classic ‘Go back to China!’ — despite the fact I have never left this continent — and make racist comments about me.
Now, when I am out in public, I am just wary of others.
If someone looks tense or they keep staring at me, I leave and walk away.
I do not want to anger them and drive them to violence.
To stop the spread of Asian hate, I would stop or prevent news outlets/sources, as well as people with political power, from saying degrading and derogatory language against Asian Americans.
I feel that ex-President Donald Trump made situations worse by pinning the blame on China for not being able to contain the virus.
He called it the ‘Chinese Virus,’ furthering his followers’ dislike against China.
It seems that some people took this response as an ‘OK’ to use hate speech and even commit hate crimes.
I would tell people to check their news sources.
Is what they are getting actually verified and reliable information?
To lessen people’s fears, don’t give into the hate.
Just because someone is of Chinese or Asian descent, does not mean they automatically have the virus; that is not how this virus works.
Do not be afraid as long as you are wearing a mask and are performing safe behaviors when outside.
I would also tell people and educate them using social media posts.
Teens are more reachable when facts are in short, colorful blurbs.
They can then repost the article on their social media accounts."

I thought about my Asian American friends, my parents who work in small Chinese businesses, all the Asian women I know who raised me, who taught me, whose immigrant blood runs through mine.
I thought about myself, how I grew up wanting to be American, not realizing I already was by my birthright, because as the extreme violence in Atlanta showed, the country does not recognize Asian people as part of the American identity.
Our failure to do the victims justice is indicative of how poorly we understand race in the United States.
It is the product of our erasure of Asian Americans in U.S. history.
We are not taught the contributions of Asian Americans in school.
We do not read Asian American stories or see Asian Americans on TV with any regularity.
The way we talk about and portray race in America is Black and white and renders Asian Americans invisible.
We do not get to humanize them and see them as real people.
So when we as a country are forced to confront the racist attacks against Asian Americans, we fail miserably.
Words have power.
The stories we select to construct our national identity have consequences.
While Asian Americans have been deemed perpetually foreign, many would be surprised to know that the first Asians in America can be traced back to as early as the 1500s.
A friend asked me recently, 'Well, how do you want people to respond?' I didn't know what to say.
I still don't.
Any chance at racial justice will require a radical reformation of how we think about race in America.
It will require partnerships with other minority groups.
Statements of solidarity must be backed by action.
As history shows, anti-Asian sentiment repeats itself.
What I will say is this.
I want to see hate-crime reform.
I want Asian American history taught in classrooms.
I want to see more Asian Americans in government, in Hollywood, on everyday bookshelves, so that one day someone might look at me and not question whether I belong here.
So that someone might look at me and not make assumptions because of my race.
I already know people like me can serve the country well, that they can be dynamic and brilliant and brave.
America must see that too."

As a researcher who studies the self-reflective process of metacognition and someone of Asian descent, it’s clear to me that underreporting of racially motivated attacks on Asian Americans happens, at least in part, because the victims are caught between American individualism and Asian collectivism.
But I can’t sit this out anymore.
I, too, have seen the videos of the attacks, and it hits too close to home.
We need to speak up.

Yusef said Thursday that, while the increase of violence against Asians and Pacific Islanders is 'terrifying,' it's worth noting that racism against those groups is nothing new.
Rather, the increase in anti-Asian attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted deeply rooted historical and transnational racism against Asians and Pacific Islanders and violence against Asian women, she said.

'If (authorities) will just say, 'he is a sex addict or he had a bad day,' then we ignore the right questions: Why would he choose a massage parlor with low-wage Asian women employees? As Asian women, we are seen as invisible, submissive. It's like we're nothing.'
Despite the terror and grief, Yusef said that, in Des Moines, the 'solidarity shown has been beautiful' in response to the Atlanta killings and increased concerns about racism and xenophobia against Asians and Pacific Islanders.

entity_2719,Article_129,Derek Kwan,professional,Asian,"For Derek Kwan, the past year has felt similar to what he witnessed almost 20 years ago.
As the coronavirus swept across the world, creating a global pandemic, it also seems to have sparked what Kwan sees as an anti-Asian sentiment, likely because the virus was first discovered in China, which led to derogatory rhetoric from some political leaders.
As someone who had lived in New York City in 2001, Kwan, now the executive director of the Lied Center, said the recent racism toward the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, also known as AAPI, felt very similar to the harmful anti-Muslim sentiment he saw after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.
To help dispel that kind of thinking, Kwan, who has lived in Lawrence since 2014 and is currently the president of the University of Kansas’ Asian and Asian-American Faculty and Staff Council, told the Journal-World he tried to find common ground with others, especially those who haven’t been exposed to much diversity.
We need to find as a society a way to not only celebrate our differences, but celebrate our commonalities in a way that is productive, Kwan said.
It’s unfortunate when rhetoric can get in the way of that.
Kwan said he too has tried to educate the people who have perpetrated racism around him to help them understand that what they were doing was harmful.
He said everyone has different lived experiences and different perspectives, and it’s important to help others realize that we are all human beings.
He said he hoped the spotlight on recent incidents would help others realize the significance of the problem and begin seeing others for their humanity rather than for their race and associated stereotypes.
Once they see you are just another human being … it can really change a person’s perspective, Kwan said.
I have always believed that if I can change the perspective of one other person, hopefully that can snowball into creating a society that can not only celebrate common ground, but also celebrate differences."

Kang said her first reaction to the shootings was dismay, but she was not shocked.
She said it appeared to be another case of stereotyping, as the killer allegedly had a sex addiction and had frequented the spa locations previously.
She said reducing someone, regardless of race, to one dimension made it easier to perpetrate violence against them.
It’s yet another case of Asian and Asian Americans being reduced to certain stereotypes, Kang said.
There’s a notion he was looking at these Asian women not as three-dimensional humans, but as sex objects.
That’s what he had reduced them down to.
Kang said she also began thinking of her parents in the Chicago area because of reports of elderly Asians in America being attacked in the streets, which she believes is associated with anti-Asian rhetoric associated with COVID-19.
Kang said she’s experienced what could be described as microaggressions, while Kwan said he had experienced racist incidents while living in North Carolina and Michigan.
She said she approached the group to tell them she had overheard their descriptions and felt that she needed to explain that they were incorrect and harmful.
I’m somebody who immediately speaks up, Kang said.

entity_2785,Article_137,President Donald Trump,politician,Non-Asian,"Rhetoric from President Donald Trump and other leaders fueled the rise, a study said.
As President Donald Trump and other US officials last year referred to the coronavirus as the 'Chinese virus,' the 'Kung Flu,' and other incendiary nicknames, a chorus of commentators warned that their rhetoric would lead to an increase in harassment and hateful speech.
While it's difficult to quantify the effects of the president's comments, the study said some of that rise could be attributed to Trump's statements.
The ADL study also linked the rise in anti-Asian American sentiment on social networks and in the real world directly to Trump's 'incendiary rhetoric' about the coronavirus.
The spike in physical violence against Asian-Americans across the nation was whipped up in large part by bigotry and conspiracy theories that grew online, fanned by national leaders, including Trump, the study said.
ADL said its researchers saw an '85 percent increase in anti-Asian sentiment on Twitter' after news broke that Trump had COVID-19.

The requests all looked the same, and they would be familiar to any minority community dealing with tragedy.
Tao was being asked these questions because eight people had been killed in a series of shootings in and around Atlanta on Tuesday night.
Six of the victims were women of Asian descent.
But even with eight people dead, there was debate about whether the attack was a hate crime.
About whether racism was the primary motive.
About whether America was finally ready to stop Asian hate.
The truth is Tao was in San Francisco for her 20th wedding anniversary a few years ago when a woman kicked her luggage and told her to go back to her country.
She hasn't experienced overt racism like that in Cincinnati.
But the truth is she often feels invisible here, which takes its own heavy toll.
Because there is no Chinatown here, and stories of prejudice against Asian people often go untold.
Tao is a communications director for the Greater Cincinnati Chinese School in Butler County, and she founded the Greater Cincinnati Chinese Cultural Exchange Association.
She is an advocate who knows Asian people are underrepresented in Cincinnati media, including The Enquirer.
She knows this because she is the one sending press releases that often go unanswered.
 We don't exist, Tao said.
Tao hasn't been directly confronted with a racist phrase describing the virus, but she's heard of others who have â including kids at school.
She does fear one question, though: Where are you from?
Because when the answer is Cincinnati, it's usually followed by another question: Where are you really from?
Tao doesn't talk to them about the violent attacks against Asian Americans that seem to be happening more frequently across the country than ever before.
Tao doesn't talk about how the number of hate crimes reported in America's biggest cities went down last year, according to a study at California State University, but the number of hate crimes reported against Asians rose 149%.
Tao knows this comes from her own insecurity, because she wants her children to believe they can do anything.
She doesn't want them to feel like victims.
Even if, sometimes, they are.
These days, Tao's own parents worry about her safety.
And friends across the world ask why her family moved to America.
Tao tries to brush off those fears, especially to her parents.
She doesn't want to scare them.
But the fear is there, inside her head.
And it comes out in tears when she talks about her sons.
Because she worries about their safety, too.
When Tao thinks about the future of our country, this can-do person who prides herself on positivity finds herself wondering something she has never wondered before.
""I have doubt,"" she said."

Rodriguez didn’t return a phone call seeking comment for this story.
As a county commissioner, Rodriguez also serves on the county’s board of health.
When Fang confronted Rodriguez at a subsequent meeting, he “apologized for the remarks and how they may have hurt people.”
“That’s not how I think,” he said. “I have everybody on my mind ... and I’ve got a lot of Chinese food here, and I’ve got some Chinese friends and stuff.”
“I know that other people are having a great problem,” he said. “And someone reminded me that in Italy, they have a lot of garment-people there, fashionists, and they have a tremendous amount of Chinese there, and that’s where a lot of it started.

Then the Manhattan woman, whose family owns and operates the Asian Market grocery store, realized how much she appreciates the community’s support.
Instead, Fang has been outspoken about the harassment of Asian Americans.
Fang returned to Manhattan a couple of years ago after studying at New York University.
This is where her parents chose to make a home in 1997 when they immigrated from a rural area of China.
“There was one day I picked up the phone and someone asked me if my family cooked cats and dogs,” Fang said.
“The difference now is I’m not 10 — I’m 24, and I now have the ability to say something.
I’m not scared anymore.
I have a very strong support system.
I’m in this.
I know it’s going to be a fight, but if I’m going to go into a fight with anybody, I’m so glad to do it with Manhattan, Kansas.”
Fang said her anxiety skyrocketed when she heard COVID-19 broke out in China, fearing racist reaction in the United States.
Fang’s immediate response: “Excuse my language for this, but it felt like a big f*** you.”
“I just can’t say it any other way,” she said.
“It made me question why I even came back to this community.”
For her, that isn’t an option.
She plans to continue to push for Rodriguez to resign and, in the alternate, vote him out of office later this year.
“My hope is that the 13-, 14-, 15-year-old Asian American at Manhattan High sees that someone in this community who looks like them is speaking up,” Fang said, “and I hope that if they stay here or if they go somewhere else, they will remember this and say, ‘I can do this.’ That’s what I hope.”"

This wasn't Yuen's only recent experience with racism since the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The U.S. itself has had a long history of Sinophobia, most notably with the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned Chinese laborers following immigration that began with the Gold Rush.
The current wave coincides, and is perhaps in part due to, the rise in nativism in the U.S., as well as the rest of the world, said Sautman.
Now, China is seen as a challenger to U.S. hegemony, and almost every aspect of what the Chinese government does has been criticized heavily.

Meanwhile, Fauci, a public health hero who's led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for over 30 years, has emerged as one of the most trusted voices in the US amid the coronavirus pandemic.

They said our soldiers started it. Our soldiers had nothing to do with it, he told Fox News on Tuesday.
It came from China. I don’t regret it, he said.
Everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn’t make any more of a big deal out of it.
I think I made a big deal, I think people understand it.
In recent days, Trump has shifted away from using the phrasing and condemned the harassment of Asian Americans, who have reported being blamed for the spread of the virus.
It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world, he tweeted.

""We can't understand things as blips or weird, unique, one-off events, but rather they're a part of systematic inequalities and ... racial oppressions,"" she said in a recent interview with the Reno Gazette Journal.
Oda said Asian-Americans have experienced rejection since the Chinese Exclusion Act, which suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers for a period of 10 years.
The Page Law, passed in 1875, also targeted primarily Chinese women brought to the U.S. for ""immoral purposes,"" according to Immigration and Ethnic History Society—a nonprofit organization based in Minnesota that promotes the study of immigration history.
 From the start, Asian laws excluded women specifically in these sexualized terms, Oda said.
Eventually, the U.S. established military bases in the Pacific and in Asia.
Oda said she believes that the Black Lives Matter movement laid down a foundation that's helping spread awareness of racial inequalities, discrimination and racism outside of the Black community.
 I think it's allowed people more broadly to be amenable to the idea that Asian-Americans also face systematic racism, Oda said.
Oda said the Trump Administration also helped create an anti-Asian American sentiment by referring to COVID-19 as the ""China flu,"" the ""Kung flu"" or the ""Wuhan virus."""

Koo, with One APIA Nevada, said understanding the history of the Asian-American communities is critical, particularly now.
Koo referenced the transcontinental railroad that connects Reno to Sacramento, which Chinese migrant workers helped build.
 The safety conditions of a lot of the workers were not very good, Koo said.
""After they completed the transcontinental railroad ... a lot of these Chinese laborers were kind of left to their own devices.

My parents immigrated from Taiwan in the 1970s, and my twin sister and I were born in Los Angeles in the 1980s.
As a mother of half-Asian Jewish children, the tragedy in Atlanta led me to fear for the safety of my children.
It's the kind of fear that you not only comprehend in your head, but one that you physically feel course through your veins.
My children will grow up in a society where some people may hate them because of the color of their skin and others may hate them for the faith that they believe in (and, of course, there are plenty who would hate them for both reasons).
I'm embarrassed to admit this, but my first reaction when thinking about how to best protect my children from the Asian and Jewish hate that they may experience was to flee.
After my initial shock over the Atlanta shootings, I found myself dramatically proclaiming to my husband that I didn't think that the United States was a safe place for our family anymore.
In the past, my husband and I have talked about moving to a different country - particularly to China or Taiwan, given that I still have many extended family members there.
And yet, upon further reflection, I recognized that fleeing the country is not the answer.
I realized that the way to keep my children safe is to do my best to make the world a safer place for them.
But some ideas I have are continuing to give tzedakah to charities that are doing important work to fight anti-Semitism and Asian hate, bringing awareness to these important issues, and continuing to stand up against hateful rhetoric.
For my children, I know it will be important to educate them on their dual Asian and Jewish identities in order to allow them to fully embrace the multi-faceted identities that they hold.

A lifetime of experiences, including the deep betrayal of a white man who abused Tornado as a child, made the news hard to bear.
Now Tornado said she’s ready to speak out and call for all people in Sonoma County to take a strong, public stance against violence because of the many ways these injustices are allowed to continue in private.

He sees this as a good thing.
He wants people to ask him for help.
Sakhone is the director of housing services at Family Bridges, a nonprofit in Oakland, California, and he’s also part of the area's Community Ambassador program.
Community ambassadors walk the streets of Chinatown to care for the neighborhood and help residents feel safe.
In a virtual tour of the area via FaceTime, Sakhone shows the spot where a 91-year-old man was shoved to the ground a few weeks ago.
He said he regrets that he wasn’t there to help.
Yeah, if I see them fall down, I'll rush to help, Sakhone said.
I always keep an eye on them.
A lot of folks are worried.
But at the same time, when I'm around, they know that I'm there to help look over them.
Just the presence of ambassadors like Sakhone seems to make a difference.
Sakhone had been incarcerated for 20 years before he was released in 2018.
To stop crime, he said you need to know why it happens.
He explained how in the pandemic, people have lost their jobs, rent prices in Oakland and elsewhere have skyrocketed, and many people have lost their homes, too.
All these stresses can compound mental health.
They have no right to do it, but it's like one way that folks express their traumas and their hurt or their pain is to take it out on people, Sakhone said.
And it's not right.
But the pandemic is hard for every community - it's hard for everyone.
I don't believe in more policing, I believe in more communication so that we could avoid these kinds of hate crimes from happening.
Many residents want justice for hate crime victims, while advocates like Sakhone believe in restorative justice.
When he sees conflict or tension, he tries to deescalate the situation by understanding the perspectives of all those involved.
One of my approaches is to ask if they're OK.
You know, 'What's going on? What do you need?' he said."

entity_3862,Article_247,Yoshi Silverstein,professional,Asian,"YOSHI SILVERSTEIN, founder of Mitsui Collective, a Jewish nature and wellness organization, said the Atlanta massacre brought back painful memories of The Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh.
'The aftermath felt exactly the same for me.
Both brought feelings of how personal it feels to have others attack a part of your identity.
It felt vulnerable and visceral,' he recalled.
'Both brought isolation and loneliness.'
Silversteinâs father is an Eastern European Jew and his mother is Chinese-American.
He calls himself a 'Chinese-Ashkenazi American Jew.'
Silverstein said that recent attacks on both of his identities have made him especially conscious to pass cultural traditions down to his three-year-old daughter.
He does so by fusing the two heritages together, like cooking scallion latkes for Hanukkah.
Last month, when the Lunar New Year fell on a Friday night, the family hosted a Chinese-themed Shabbat dinner.
'Despite the similarities between the two shootings,' Silverstein continued, 'it feels like there is a bigger gap following the Atlanta attacks, because it wasnât something that impacted all Jews.
It impacted Asian folks, and of course the overlap of Asian Jews.
Early on, it was like: Are any non-Asian Jews paying attention?
It brought me a different feeling of isolation.'
But Silverstein, 37, also found comfort in the support he has received from the Jewish community since the Atlanta massacre.
'The day after, I saw other Asians, most of whom were not Jewish, expressing how they were feeling.
That hit home for me.
Then I was tagged in a solidarity post from a Black-Jewish liberation collective, which brought a lot of emotions for me.
I needed that,' he recalled.
'A lot of folks from different Jewish corners have reached out to me, but I think I may be unique in that because Iâve worked in the Jewish world for a long time and have a lot of personal contacts.'"

We did all our shopping, all the things that we need to do during the day and not go shopping at night – shopping in pairs, taking care of our families, our grandparents, our elderly parents, our elderly uncles and aunts, making sure they don't go to a store by themselves.
If our grandparents or our mothers or fathers are going outside, even beyond our home, just to the garden next to our home, we watch them.
We make sure that we are able to see them, that there's a window to protect them.
The 'model minority myth,' a stereotype that says all Asian Americans are successful and problem-free, has often hidden racism toward Asian Americans, Her said.
As the model minority, we have been very invisible and ... even in spaces where we are the leader of those spaces, our voices a lot of times blend in with everything else.
I think that with everything that is happening, the invisibility of the Asian community is coming to the surface now.

We kind of understood and felt that people didn't want to come to the shop as much anymore just because of the fact that we're an Asian store.
In April, the market's service vans were vandalized with a racist message related to COVID-19, Yang said.
But she noticed racism in other subtle ways, too, like when someone would go out of their way to avoid being around her when she was shopping at another grocery store or when she went to the bank to help her parents apply for a business loan.

In New York City, the study found crimes targeting Asian Americans went up 833%.

In March, the FBI warned of an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans in light of COVID-19.

Newlin is a fourth-generation Wyomingite and fourth-generation Japanese American whose great-grandparents were imprisoned at Heart Mountain in the 1940s.
Newlin, who recounted two relatively recent xenophobic encounters in an opinion column published in the Casper Star-Tribune last week, characterized the bigoted sentiments in reaction to COVID-19 as “disappointing and horrifying, but not surprising.”
She said she hopes places like the Heart Mountain Interpretive Center, which is set to open an exhibit on disease stigma next month, and a stronger emphasis on Asian American history in the classroom will slowly help to change that reality.
The current generation of politicians wouldn’t have learned about any of this in school,” Newlin said."
entity_4012,Article_263,Davin Ro,victim,Asian,"But, Ro, a sophomore and second-generation Korean-American, hasn’t forgotten what happened on a walk to class last fall as COVID-19 cases surged in Laramie County.
He heard a group of students loudly “expressing their hate for all Asians for bringing the virus to ’their proud America.’” The comment upset Ro, who is part of the 1% of East students who identify as Asian, but he wanted to avoid “escalating the problem,” and ignored them.
Then, the students’ comments got more targeted.
“They looked at me and tried to point the blame at me,” he recalled in an interview with the Wyoming Tribune Eagle last week.
“They told me to go back to my country and take my virus with me. (They said) I’m not wanted here because I killed and infected so many people.”
Ro, who was born in the United States, said being blamed for a pandemic he has no control over was at once baffling and hurtful.
He did the political calculus, however, and decided “to brush it off.” It wasn’t worth it to report the bullies, he said, fearing possible backlash.
From Ro’s point of view, what happened last fall is one example of how Laramie County School District 1 “hasn’t changed at all” since the McCormick Junior High School episode of 2019, in which a student posted homophobic and racist fliers on campus.
A subsequent investigation showed it wasn’t an isolated incident within the school, and likely the district, and that staff both inadequately responded to or aided in the bullying."
entity_4013,Article_263,Asian women,victim,Asian,"But at least one student isn’t waiting on new policies to combat pervasive racist stigmas – like the kind that played a role in the bullying of Ro last fall, the massacre of Asian women near Atlanta, Georgia, last week, and the dramatic uptick in violence against Asian-Americans over the past year."
entity_4014,Article_263,YuYu Yuan,professional,Asian,"But one of his classmates, YuYu Yuan, is a champion orator who is using her voice to raise awareness about the harmful consequences of blaming ethnic or minority groups for the spread of diseases.
YuYu Yuan is an award-winning orator who helped East High School’s speech and debate team clench its fourth state championship in as many years last weekend.
All year, she’s been delivering – and perfecting – a powerful speech titled 'Are you sick of me yet?'
Her speech runs through the long history of scapegoating ethnic and minority groups for the spread of diseases, and explores how that rhetoric has led to widespread xenophobic reactions to the COVID-19 virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.
“Yes, this has fueled anti-Asian sentiment, but this isn’t new.
People have used diseases before as a way to target minority groups,” said Yuan, who moved with her family from southeast China to the U.S. at the age of 4.
She wrote her speech, which has already won five awards this school year, about disease stigma to raise awareness about the consequences of prejudiced thinking.
“I think it’s something everyone should know about, so that we’re more conscious of our actions, our words and how we’re phrasing things,” Yuan said.
“What I wanted to translate to people is that this is a real thing that affects people everywhere, even though there might not be a lot of blatant anti-Asian sentiment in Cheyenne.”
Yuan said she feels “lucky” to have been spared the bullying Ro experienced through the pandemic, but it was never a given.
When Wyoming reported its first COVID-19 cases around this time last year, Yuan said she wasn’t too concerned, and was excited about getting a few extra days off from school.
But it soon became clear that neither the virus, nor the anti-Asian rhetoric it unleashed, were going anywhere.
And that’s when the fear set in.
A routine trip to Walmart – where she was one of the few wearing a face mask at the start of the pandemic – suddenly felt intense.
“I noticed people staring, and it felt very uncomfortable to be in that situation,” Yuan said.
“In that moment, I was just scared that someone was going to say something racist or do something to me.
That’s what I was really scared of when the pandemic first hit Cheyenne.”
Yuan, who plans to pursue a career in politics or advocacy, has participated in speech and debate since freshman year.
Now a senior, speech and debate gave her an outlet to process her trepidation about anti-Asian violence and rhetoric this year.
“Diseases can kill us, but fear is what will end us,” reads one of the most poignant lines.
“It makes me sick to my stomach,” Yuan said.
“This has happened before, and it makes me upset that we haven’t learned from the past.”"

But the stigmatization of Chinese immigrants as a threat to public health and safety has a long history in the United States.
The consequences were deadly.
A mob massacred 19 Chinese men in Los Angeles in 1871, and anti-Chinese race riots erupted in cities such as San Francisco, Vancouver, and Seattle.
Living on the periphery was no protection.
As urban travelers in the West rode railroads built by Chinese migrants to take in the pure air of nature resorts, more than 100 violent purges forced Chinese immigrants out of rural settlements and into overcrowded, poorly ventilated accommodations in urban Chinatowns.
This law was enforced exclusively against Chinese people, and critics noted that the city detained Chinese immigrants in jails that were much more overcrowded than their homes.
Sanitation became a common pretext for disciplining and displacing Chinese residents.
In a 1999 case in Pennsylvania, grease smells from Wok's Chinese Restaurant were deemed 'noxious' even though, the defendant noted, they were comparable to the smell of burning wood from a nearby pizza restaurant.
Attributing Chinatown's poor air quality to cultural and biological differences, so-called experts like Bancroft drew attention away from the forces of mob violence, poverty, social marginalization, and housing inequity that had pushed Chinese immigrants into substandard living conditions."

The phone calls 'devastated' her, she said, so much so that she had to stop for her own mental health.
Some people told her they found themselves increasingly paranoid, with one couple sleeping during the day after teenagers rang their doorbell at night.

Kulp ducked into the lobby of an apartment building to collect himself.

Niemi said a wave of anti-Asian racism linked to the coronavirus had caught many places unprepared.

As the abuse escalated - 'very negative comments [about] the coronavirus ... go home, you don't belong here' - the man punched her in the head twice, knocking her to the ground.
'I've been in situations like this before, being indigenous,' Holmes said.
'I try not to get involved. I try not to say anything back ... I think the only thing I said was 'I'm not Asian, I'm indigenous, I'm from here, I've been here my whole life'.'
Holmes said her attacker was a Caucasian man, about 180cm tall and weighing about 90kg, wearing a hat and a dark jumper.
She said the man had passed her from the opposite direction and was about two metres behind her when she sneezed because of her seasonal allergies.
He immediately started shouting abuse.
'When I turned around to face him, he started coming at me, yelling in my face and then he punched me, in the jaw, and then above my eye, my temple area,' she said.
Holmes said she fell to the ground, but felt she was saved from worse by Kato, a 45kg Dogo Argentino that Holmes adopted three years ago.
The man responded by threatening to have authorities confiscate Kato because the dog was 'being aggressive'.
Holmes returned to her nearby home and called her father, Don Bain - a special adviser to British Columbia Premier John Horgan - who calmed her down.
An hour later she called the police and met them back at the park.

A bit more discord ensued, and when the gaggle of reporters wouldn’t move on, Trump abruptly ended the press conference and stormed out.
Trump has been laying blame for the coronavirus pandemic on China and on its regime since day one of the crisis.

Right before the pandemic struck New York City, she left for Massachusetts to stay with her parents, âisolated from any other human being other than my family.â
And so, her family has become the subject of her quarantine videos.
Hausmann actually canât imagine going through the pandemic without having family around.
In Latin America, itâs the norm.
âBack home in Venezuela, the people that are with the most amount of family members are doing the best.
Those that are the most isolated are not doing so great.â
At her parentsâ house, Hausmann doesnât have the professional crew she normally works with.
So, sheâs enlisted her younger cousin whoâs learning on the fly how to edit video.
The realization that her work doesnât need to be perfect has been liberating for her.
âThereâs no reason why I shouldn't post that video that I shot on an iPhone,â she said.

Recently, Zou received a package from the Chinese embassy in Washington that contained protective KN95 and surgical masks, medications, sanitizing wipes and a brochure to help Chinese students stay healthy in the US.
 I was moved to tears a little as my heart was warmed by such care and solicitude, and by not feeling isolated and lonely anymore, Zou said.

Zou found the hospital closest to her, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, and registered her donation information.
On April 28, Zou, with another classmate, donated all of her KN95 masks and three bags of disinfectant wipes to the hospital.

But the discrimination, racism and xenophobia that's been aimed at the Asian community during the COVID-19 crisis has put a damper on such spirits.
The star of CBC's 'Kim's Convenience' and Marvel's upcoming film 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' says he's heard from countless people who have experienced such discrimination and he's faced it himself during the pandemic.
He's hoping to shift the narrative by celebrating Asian and South Asian Heritage Month this month - and spotlighting the works of notable Asian Canadians - on social media as a new ambassador for Made / Nous, a movement recognizing creative Canadian talent.
 I think it is especially important now in this day and age, at this time where anti-Asian sentiment and xenophobia is higher than it's ever been in a very long time - and I don't think you can argue that, Liu said in a recent phone interview from Sydney, where he was filming 'Shang-Chi' until the pandemic halted production.
""Every day, I see more instances of hate crimes and discrimination, not only in Canada but the U.S. and Australia, where I'm at.
There have been a lot of cases of people getting spat on in the street, verbally abused, physically abused.
It's really easy to be weighed down by all of this hate that's brewing in the world.""
Liu, who immigrated to Canada from northern China at age five, and grew up in Etobicoke and Mississauga, said he felt such discrimination first-hand when he was recently walking out of a restaurant in Sydney before the pandemic lockdown came into full force.
""I had a piece of food in my throat and I was trying to get it out, and was coughing and hacking a little bit,"" he said.
""And this white guy comes out of a restaurant with a woman and looks over at me and, without even thinking about it, he just says 'Coronavirus' and chuckles to himself and keeps walking.
""I was honestly so shocked in that moment that I didn't even know how to react.
And I did just kind of brush it off ... But it's just a taste of what is going on in the world right now and what collectively people are thinking.""
Liu added: ""I feel like if you're an Asian person in the world in 2020, you're fighting a virus on two fronts.
We are, like every single other person in this world, at the mercy of this COVID thing.
And then we're also at the same time fighting this virus of hate that has apparently spread and infected just as many people, if not more.""
He celebrated his birthday last month by asking his social media followers to donate to either the Trillium Health Partners hospital system in Mississauga or a health network of their choice.
The initiative raised more than $10,000, Liu said, noting he matched that figure himself in a donation spread among different hospitals and non-profits.
His advice for those facing racism at this time is 'not to buy into this 'go-back-to-where-you-came-from, you-don't-belong-here' kind of mentality and rhetoric that is being propagated by some top politicians.'
""You belong exactly where you are, and you deserve to stand on your own two feet and hold your head high no matter what,"" he said.
""Call it out when you see it and then reach out if you ever feel like you need somebody to talk to, because I think the aim with a lot of these angry people is to make us feel alone and isolated.""
Liu said he's happy to hear from those who want to reach out to him on social media.
And he noted that hate crimes can also be reported to authorities.
""We're all in this together,"" he said.
""We're going through it and we're fighting for each other's causes.
And together we're going to get through it, as long as we keep being active in holding these individuals accountable for their actions and their words.
""A big part of why this has gotten so much media coverage is because Asian people who have been attacked are refusing to let it go and they're filming their perpetrators.
""And we're making an effort to call out these attacks and not brush them off, and to take it seriously."

Two years later, he learned about Apex from his mother's social worker.

Apex recently surveyed 100 students on the social effects of the pandemic.
Half the respondents expressed concern or anxiety about anti-Asian discrimination, and 15 per cent said they had directly experienced racism.

If bullying is conducted online, for example, Apex suggests young people should unfollow and report the bully or speak out.
If someone is being taunted in person, a bystander could stand beside them for moral support or help the victim leave the scene.
If they feel comfortable, they could speak out - but focus on the idea or behaviour, not the instigator of the attack.
Apex also encourages young people to point out that the coronavirus pandemic has nothing to do with ethnicity, or, if they know the person, engage in a conversation, Chung says.

Historically, minorities, especially Black Americans, have experienced backlash in the form of hostility when they've asserted their rights in a strong and publicized way, Tosouni said.
The heightened awareness over racial justice-related issues may have also had an impact on local police officers, who ultimately determine whether a crime merits a hate crime classification, Tosouni said.
Cases that an officer may have not classified as a hate crime in the past, such a fight in which racial slurs were made by one of the parties, may have received that classification in light of the national discourse on race, Tosouni said.
 It might be the case that hate crimes have increased against Black Americans, or it might be the case that police departments in our country, and California in general are starting to be more assertive, Tosouni said."

Jeung said he often spends his day being 'pulled from all sides,' tending to media requests, working with corporations interested in donating to Stop AAPI Hate and attending listening sessions run by the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and the White House.
Each day, he said, he goes through 'the range of emotions, from anger to depression to hope.'
'We're still grieving over the Atlanta shootings. We're still angered by seeing our elderly pushed and shoved,' Jeung said."

Even within his own family, the racist harassment Lim faced was not unique.
Later that summer, with incidents on the rise, Lim decided to do something.
He became a volunteer with Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition based in California that has recorded nearly 7,000 hate incidents involving Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders nationwide since the beginning of the pandemic and created reports based on their findings.
'Collecting the data and reporting on the data and getting in front of the media and other folks was really important,' state Senator Richard Pan, who chairs the California Legislature's Asian Pacific Islander Caucus, said of the coalition's work.
'We've grown to be more than just a data collection center,' Lim said.

It was hard to leave my country but even though I wasn’t sure about how different things would be culturally in Australia, I wasn’t too worried.
I knew it to be a multicultural nation and Australians have a reputation overseas for being friendly and inclusive.
I felt welcomed as soon as I landed.
When you wear a headscarf you get used to people openly staring, but while I’ve had my share of ‘f...ing Muslim’ comments in the streets, I’ve only ever had two major incidents where the behaviour has been extreme.

She yelled, ‘We have a stupid government letting stupid Muslims like you into our country.’
She was aggressive and intimidating.
The second time was at the Royal Sydney Easter Show when I picked up an egg in the barn, not knowing this was something I was not allowed to do, and a man nearby began screaming at me.
He was annoyed about the egg but made his argument about my religion, background and about people not understanding where they belong.
Both times I held my ground and defended my right to be in Australia but these experiences are infuriating.
Yes, of course it’s their country but it’s my country, too.
What’s more, I love this country by choice.

She attended recent protests in Harrisburg and Baltimore and said that she was able to have some very enlightening conversations with people because of it.

Thomas said that the racism she experienced in Hanover was why she left the area, ""because I just didn't want to have to keep going through that as an adult.""
 I think that if we continue this way with all this racial intensity, we will fail as America, we will fail because it takes all of us to run this country it takes all of us to do what needs to be done, and we owe it to our children, not just our Black children but white children as well, Thomas said."

Though many people use platforms like Facebook to share information about the protests and the movements, much of those posts are followed by backlash.
While he was organizing the Hanover protest, Anselmi said rumors on social media were circulating about a bus of Black people going from Baltimore to Hanover.
He said the attention that rumor gained appalled him.
""Then I see their reaction to the idea of a few Black people being sent up here in buses, and they are terrified.
It's like the reaction was like, we're being threatened with an invasion from a hostile foreign country, Anselmi said.
This was his reaction to this rumor, the events of which never actually occurred on the day of the protest: First: ""They have their own mess down there and I'm sure that not too many people have the time to come up to Hanover.""
Second: ""They just got national news recognition for a very peaceful protest that policemen partook in.""

'We started to realize all the logistical implications if we were to open a standard pantry, where people line up to get their food. Standing in line for half an hour not only exposes seniors to a greater risk of being infected, but also is physically and mentally exhausting,' she added.
Chen, from Immigrant Social Services Inc, said: 'I know people who have started rationing food among three generations of a family. Waiting for unemployment benefit - which takes months to apply for - and not knowing when they will get their jobs back, they are trying to make their food reserves last a bit longer.'

Lai, the executive director, said: 'The impact of COVID-19 was palpably felt here even before it landed on American shores.

entity_5446,Article_425,Dr. Jasmine Marcelin,professional,Asian,"Business Insider spoke to Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, a doctor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald, a researcher of implicit bias, to gain a greater understanding of bias in medicine.
Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, who co-authored The Impact of Unconscious Bias in Healthcare: How to Recognize and Mitigate It in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, said a lower presence of minorities in the medical field perpetuates bias.
The field of infectious diseases is also affected by implicit bias, according to Dr. Marcelin.
She is passionate about reducing biases in the field of infectious disease.
""I definitely think from a pandemic standpoint there is a huge risk for minority groups who are affected. We have a lot of data that shows that the effects of systemic racism and bias on minority groups has led to worse outcomes in those groups,"" she said.
Dr. Marcelin shared that she herself has experienced bias in the workplace — from both patients and colleagues — as an African American female doctor.
Dr. Marcelin, not pictured, said, ""There are many times that I have walked into patient situations and they have assumed that I am not the one that's in charge, even after I have identified myself as being the attending.""
""I've had other healthcare professionals barging in on me in the middle of talking with patients and completely ignoring my presence in the room with the patient.""
 I've had patients who asked me to take out their trash.""
Minorities in the healthcare field often have to pay the 'minority tax' at work, Dr. Marcelin added.
That is, they expend extra time and effort trying to combat bias and educate others on the effects of bias, with no compensation for their work.
According to Dr. Marcelin's research, although the US population is 13% African American and 18% Hispanic, only 3% of full-time medical school faculty is African American and only 4% is Hispanic.
In medicine, high rates of diversity lead to excellence in treatment.
""Diversity is better overall for everyone. So what needs to [change] is more white people, especially straight white men, who need to embrace the importance of diversity and inclusion and equity."""
entity_5447,Article_425,Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald,professional,Cannot be inferred,"Business Insider spoke to Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, a doctor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald, a researcher of implicit bias, to gain a greater understanding of bias in medicine.
Explicit biases, or conscious biases, are easier to detect because they are overt, according to Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald, who co-authored Implicit bias in healthcare professionals: a systematic review, which was published in BMC Medical Ethics.
""If someone had explicit bias, they might say, 'Oh, you know, obese people just don't work as hard, or they're lazy,'"" Dr. Fitzgerald told Business Insider.
However, ""if it was implicit, they might choose someone else over an obese person to do a task because they'll assume the obese person will be slower to do it,"" she said.
Dr. Fitzgerald said black women were historically abused by white doctors performing gynecological procedures on them without their consent.
These doctors held the false belief that black women somehow experienced less pain.
Heart attacks, for example, can be experienced differently by women, and doctors have misdiagnosed women who've had them.
""Women can experience pain in heart attacks in quite different ways that don't fit what we often think of as the classic heart attack,"" said Dr. Fitzgerald.
Men are also affected by biases.
They are less likely to be diagnosed with mental health issues since they present them differently, said Dr. Fitzgerald.
Depressed men may present as angry rather than sad, according to the University of Rochester Medical Center.
It is also often harder for men with depression to get help, due to stereotypes of sadness as weakness in men.
""Stereotypes against the obese may manifest in a lack of effort to make a connection with the patient, spending less time in clinical interaction and ultimately less investigation of different diagnoses,'"" said Dr. Fitzgerald.
Though the medical field shares the same biases as the general population, some specialties, like pediatrics, display somewhat lower levels, said Dr. Fitzgerald.
A 2008 study found implicit biases in pediatrics to be slightly lower than biases towards adults."

After the incident, Yuan said she has avoided public places that she feels might put her at risk of being targeted again.

Yuan, who moved to the U.S. 13 years ago and has lived in Austin with her husband and two children since 2011, responded to the survey.

Jeung helped start Stop AAPI Hate, an online system in which people across the country can report racially charged incidents against Asian Americans through a form translated into more than 10 languages.
We launched it, and immediately we got flooded with responses, and using the data we’ve been sharing it with local jurisdictions,” Jeung said.
Jeung said that, from March 19 through July 1, the organization received more than 2,120 reports of racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans from across the country.
In more than 500 cases, Jeung said people reported being told to go back to China.
Jeung said Trump's rhetoric on China makes Asian Americans more vulnerable to racist attacks.
Trump makes the connection that the virus is Chinese, but he also normalizes the hate,” Jeung said.

Thiessen, 55, of Fond du Lac is a hate crime because Thiessen was targeted because of his race — Thiessen was white and defendant Daniel Navarro, a Mexican-American, told police he intended to kill a white person.
Navarro stated he intentionally crashed into the motorcycle, head-on, District Attorney Eric Toney said in a criminal complaint.
Fond du Lac County Sheriff's Sgt. Logan Will, who spoke with Navarro minutes after the July 3 crash, said Navarro told him, ""It was intentional, sir.""
Prosecutors also say Navarro said white people had been harassing him, ""giving him acid"" and contaminated him with a chemical sterilizer.
Navarro, 27, is charged with first-degree intentional homicide with a deadly weapon as a hate crime, and first-degree recklessly endangering safety with a dangerous weapon, as a hate crime.
When he spoke to deputies at the crash scene, and detectives later that night, Navarro told sheriff's officials he hadn't nodded off at the wheel.
Nor did he claim Thiessen was riding in a way that would have caused Navarro to think he needed to defend himself against the motorcyclist, based on what witnesses told police.
That limits his options in terms of a criminal defense, meaning his best defense might involve employing an ""insanity defense"" — making the case about his mental condition.

Since then, Kim says, she has been subject to thousands of such messages up to 30 a day since Covid-19 started.
It has understandably been a factor in her mental health over the years and she sat out last season because her 'mental health was in a bad place' - though she claims she is now inured to the idiots.
Prompted by a message received just minutes earlier where she was called a 'dumb Asian b****', Kim shared some of the worst things she was sent on Instagram, explaining why she took the decision in a post midweek.
'Just to be clear,' the 20-year-old began an Instagram story.
'These messages don't affect me any more. I've received this type of hate for so many years that I've grown numb to it.
But I don't want to allow these people to continue spreading negativity and being blatantly racist on social media.
'So I've decided to post every single one I see, and I ask you all to report their accounts so they get taken down immediately, and I encourage you all to do the same.
And to the haters, I'm sorry, but shut the f*** up.
No one cares for your negativity, it's disgusting.
Being racist and rude isn't a good look and I genuinely feel sorry for you.
It's not that hard to be a decent human being, maybe you should try it out sometime.
Still Kim, who burst into international prominence at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in 2018 where the 17-year-old won the gold medal in the half-pipe, has become the latest athlete to speak up in the absence of action from the tech companies or legislators.
'I remember the first time I got one of these was when I was 13 and won my first medal at the X Games,' she wrote.
'An accomplishment I was so incredibly proud of myself for but instead I was getting bashed for being Asian.
'And honestly. I feel really helpless and afraid at times.
I'm really struggling and it's been gut-wrenching to see how so many Asian Americans are being attacked for literally no reason at all.'
'I have tasers, pepper spray, a knife.
If I go outside to walk my dog or go to the grocery store,' Kim said.
'My fanny pack has all three of those in it and my hand never leaves my side.'
She told ESPN she also fears for her South Korean parents in the current climate and removed the Instagram app from her phone.
'I used to love responding to fans, but I don't look at my messages much any more.
Even if you get thousands of supportive messages, the hateful one will hit you the most.'
Kim has had to deal with this while preparing to defend her Olympic half-pipe title in Beijing next year and somehow is not distracting her so far.
She didn't need to speak out and is all the braver for doing so after keeping silent for years.
As one of the few high profile Asian-American women across sport she is an easy target.
Never mind Beijing 2022, give her a gold medal for being, as she so succinctly put it, a decent human being."

entity_5979,Article_480,Ty Penserga,politician,Asian,"Horrific accounts of violence targeting Asian Americans have dominated headlines in recent weeks, but Boynton Beach Vice Mayor Ty Penserga can attest it's not a recent phenomenon.
Penserga, born in the Philippines and the only elected official in Palm Beach County of Asian descent, said he was 'bullied and picked on' as a kid for his looks and vividly recalls getting 'jumped' at JFK Middle School in Riviera Beach by a pair of attackers using made-up words like 'chong' and 'ching' while they beat on him.
Penserga, 32, will be one of the speakers Saturday afternoon at a vigil in Lake Worth Beach's Bryant Park to remember the victims in a surge of attacks against Asian Americans around the country, including in Atlanta where six Asian American women were among eight people killed during a shooting rampage on March 16.
Asian Americans, Penserga said, are 'seen as the punching bag. We are the ones that nobody is afraid of. We are the ones that don't fight back. That's what I wish would change. People need to know that we will fight back and that we are a political force to be reckoned with.'
A paucity of established national political leaders have made Asian Americans an easy group to target, Penserga laments.
He draws a comparison with Black people and figures like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson 'who organize, bring attention, apply pressure and get people to change' when social issues affect their community.
'We don't have that,' Penserga said.
Penserga, a chemistry teacher at Suncoast High School, said that he was recently asked by one of his students why it was wrong to refer to the 'China virus.'
'What Trump has done is give permission to people to lash out, to make snide comments, to blame Asian Americans for all these problems, and it has only exacerbated the situation,' said Penserga, who emigrated to the U.S. with his mother when he was 6.
'But it was there long before this.'
Despite his own early experience with anti-Asian bigotry, Penserga said he didn't realize the depth of the problem until he was a student at Temple University in Philadelphia.
Penserga said his speech at Saturday's vigil will include the 'complicated fact' that several of the recent incidents in which Asian Americans were victimized were allegedly perpetrated by Black men.
Comparisons between Blacks and Asian Americans, who are perceived to be succeeding in America despite their minority status, have long existed in order to divide the races, Penserga said.
'I don't have the answer to solving racism, but more racism is not the solution,' Penserga said.
Penserga, who was raised in Boynton Beach, said he hasn't been singled out for physical violence since middle school, but has been subjected to more subtle racism, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak.
At the beginning of the pandemic, Penserga said people 'would just move out of my way' when he went grocery shopping.
He still 'gets looks' and hears muffled comments from other customers when he enters restaurants.
'They're uncomfortable that you're there and want you to get up and leave,' Penserga said.
'But I'm not getting up and leaving.'"

Once the numbness wore off, Chong shares said she felt violated.
Chong has not been deterred from sharing her love of cooking throughout the pandemic.
On March 20, Chong set up her dumpling stand at the ASAP Farmers Market with a mission: to donate all proceeds to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Women Lead and NQPIA, the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance.
'It felt good and it was heartwarming to know that people are becoming aware and trying to take a stand,' said Chong, who raised more than $1,200 that day for the two groups supporting Asian women.
'Still, there's more work to be done, and Chong said she'll continue to use her voice to lift up the Asian community and bring awareness to ongoing violence.'
'I still think there is a large part of the population that does not see us or understand what is happening,' she said.
'Eliminating racism, said Chong, will take more than not being racist; it will require actively working to be anti-racist.'
'It can't always come from the people who are targeted,' said Chong.
'It has to come from power, and in the United States white people have a lot of power - it's time for that community to speak up.'
'We have to be comfortable being uncomfortable,' Chong said."

Biden is incapable of leading the United States.
Biden's Vice-Presidential choice is evidence that he has lost touch with reality and is on a sojourn to Cloud Kookoo Land.
Biden lacks the charisma or character to amount to anything without his handlers and managers scripting everything he says or does.
Biden's presidency is a crime against all persons suffering from dementia to place them in such a demanding position when they are not certain of whether they are still alive.
Biden is the architect of the most draconian laws on the earth that racially targeted millions of Black Americans to be gulag and warehoused in prisons that renewed constitutionally sanction slavery for Black Americans.
