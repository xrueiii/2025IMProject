        "The star of CBC's 'Kim's Convenience' and Marvel's upcoming film 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' says he's heard from countless people who have experienced such discrimination and he's faced it himself during the pandemic.",
        "He's hoping to shift the narrative by celebrating Asian and South Asian Heritage Month this month - and spotlighting the works of notable Asian Canadians - on social media as a new ambassador for Made / Nous, a movement recognizing creative Canadian talent.",
        " I think it is especially important now in this day and age, at this time where anti-Asian sentiment and xenophobia is higher than it's ever been in a very long time - and I don't think you can argue that, Liu said in a recent phone interview from Sydney, where he was filming 'Shang-Chi' until the pandemic halted production.",

        "\"I had a piece of food in my throat and I was trying to get it out, and was coughing and hacking a little bit,\" he said.",

        "And I did just kind of brush it off ... But it's just a taste of what is going on in the world right now and what collectively people are thinking.\"",
        "Liu added: \"I feel like if you're an Asian person in the world in 2020, you're fighting a virus on two fronts.",
        "We are, like every single other person in this world, at the mercy of this COVID thing.",
        "And then we're also at the same time fighting this virus of hate that has apparently spread and infected just as many people, if not more.\"",
